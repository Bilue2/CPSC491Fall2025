An ever growing number of Americans\nprefer to get their news online [ 41], social media is being used for\npublic health announcements [ 87], and authorities provide pub-\nlic disaster education and services via Web portals [ 33]\u2014just to\nmention a few examples. Communication of critical information\nsuch as emergency response [ 10, Chapter 3] and provisioning of\ncritical services are no exception to this trend. Research shows that\nin emergencies the public turns to official and authoritative sources\nespecially when specific, precise, and trustworthy information is re-\nquested [ 20,24,29]. At the same time, evaluating the credibility and\ntrustworthines of online service providers during an emergency\nor crisis poses a real challenge for users [ 59]. A recent example to\nillustrate such situations is the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)\npandemic and its outbreak in the US in early 2020: with government\ninstitutions and health authorities being perceived as the most (so-\ncial media being the least) trustworthy sources of information by\nthe public [ 36,73], alone in the first month of the outbreak, nearly\nhalf a billion visits were registered on websites of Centers for Dis-\neases Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes\nof Health (NIH) [ 3]. Similarly, the high amount of visits on state\nunemployment websites brought the operation of many of those\nsites to a halt [ 16]. The high demand for COVID-related online\nservices took place in parallel with an explosion of misinforma-\ntion campaigns and fraudulent services. Despite efforts from top\ntech companies [ 82] the overwhelming infodemic [91] continued to\ngrow and prevail [ 15]. This over-abundance of information posed\nserious challenges both to politics and public health, and the grow-\ning number of individuals and business relying on unemploymentIf you cite this paper, please use the WWW reference: Pouyan Fotouhi Tehrani, Eric Osterweil, Jochen H.

We systematically\ninvestigate the digital representation of emergency and disaster\nmanagement organizations in the U.S. through the lens of the Do-\nmain Name System (DNS), its Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [ 7\u20139],\nandthe Web PKI (see Figure 1). Based on our threat model, we aim\nto understand whether and how specific integration of these orga-\nnizations in the domain namespace and their use of DNSSEC and\nX.509 certificates can mitigate threats against trustworthy commu-\nnication. The point of departure for our study is the list of Alerting\nAuthorities (AA) provided by FEMA [ 35], which comprises all enti-\nties (the US governmental and non-governmental organizations)\non federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local levels authorized to\ndispatch alerts.\nOur key finding shows that only about 22%, i.e.,291 out of a\ntotal 1327 unique hosts, provide sufficient measures to ensure trust-\nworthy identification. This decomposes as follow: ( i) only half the\ninvestigated organizations are uniquely identifiable based on dedi-\ncated domain names while the rise of multitenancy structures and\nshared certificates throughout the past decade has complicated\nidentifications in general and has also led to an expansion of attack\nsurfaces [ 67], (ii) the majority of organizations ( \u224864%) do not take\nadvantage of restricted namespaces for better protection against\nname spoofing and more than 96% of investigated DNS zones are\nsusceptible to DNS attacks due to lack of DNSSEC, and finally ( iii)\nabout 15% are exposed to content poisoning as a result of invalid\nor no certificates. In more detail, in this paper we contribute:\n(1)Threat model (Section 3) . We introduce a threat model\nthat integrates different characteristics of DNS and Web PKI\ninto groups of Assurances Profiles that qualifies various de-\ngrees of reachable security.\n(2)Method (Section 4) . Our method identifies common public\nAlerting Authorities in the US and corresponding websites.\nThe modular and configurable pipeline introduced here for\ndata collection and analysis maintains a certain level of gen-\nerality which makes it suitable to be extended to non-US\nregions in future work.(3)Analysis of namespace structure and protection (Sec-\ntion 5) . We map names of Alerting Authorities to fully qual-\nified domain names (FQDN) and identify operational depen-\ndencies. Usage of restricted and protected namespaces as\nwell as penetration of DNSSEC among AAs are investigated\nin this section. We also studied whether there are discrepan-\ncies between organizations from various fields of operation\n(e.g.,governmental, military).\n(4)Analysis of Web PKI (Section 6) We analyze Web PKI\ncertificates used to authenticate and identify Alerting Au-\nthorities. On the one hand the historical and actual usage of\nX.509 are studied, and on the other hand it is investigated\nhow widespread these technologies are, which certificate\nauthorities are leading the market among AAs, and how (au-\ntomated) domain-validation certificates affect trustworthy\ncommunication.\nWhile prior work has investigated the deployment of security\nprotections broadly across different application domains, to the best\nof our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the security\nprofiles of official critical (and critical-to-life) Alerting Authorities.\nAfter presenting background and our results, we discuss improving\nmeasures and conclude with an outlook.\nEmergency management (EM) can be understood as an ongoing\ncycle of mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering\nfrom incidents that threaten life, property, operations, or the envi-\nronment [ 11,13]. The core objectives of emergency management,\nranging from coordination efforts to raising awareness and critical\nservice provision, are carried out by governmental agencies, NGOs,\nvolunteer groups, and international organizations. The structure\nand organization of these entities differ in each country and even\non local and regional levels. In the US, the list of Alerting Authori-\nties regularly published by FEMA [ 35] provides a non-exhaustive\noverview of organizations which are (directly or indirectly) involved\nin the process of emergency management.\nIn each phase of EM cycle, communication (between and among\nauthorities and the public) plays an integral role not just as a mere\nnecessity but also in amounting to social resilience [ 58]. Beside\nusing dedicated alerting systems, e.g., FEMA\u2019s Integrated Public\nAlert & Warning System [34], social media, or similar channels for\ninformation dissemination, many involved organizations have their\nown dedicated websites not only for informational purposes but\nalso for services such as volunteer registry or disaster aid applica-\ntion ( e.g.,Homeland Security\u2019s disasterassistance.gov ).\nIn this paper we investigate the namespace structure, DNSSEC\npenetration, and deployment of Web PKI certificates among Alert-\ning Authorities to maintain secure communication (as defined in the\nnext section). The global domain name system (DNS), a distributed\nkey-value database with a hierarchical namespace and management\nscheme, is de facto the entry point to many (if not all) of Internet\nservices. Respectively, for critical service providers, e.g.,Alerting\nAuthorities, it is indispensable to be represented within namespaces\nprotected both in organizational and technical terms: top-level do-\nmains (TLD) with restricted naming and delegation policies protect\ndomain name owners against name and trademark violations whileMeasuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia\nTable 1: Assurance profiles (  : strong,G #: weak,#: inadequate) based on the interplay of DNS and X.509 certificate characteris-\ntics (\u2713: deployed, \u2718: not deployed) and security implications for users ( : fulfilled, : dependent protection, : inadequate).\nNote if OV or EV certification is deployed, then domain validation is covered and not further assessed (\u2013).\nDNS Web PKI Security ImplicationsAssurance\nProfile # Restricted TLD DNSSEC DV OV/EV Identification Resolution Transaction Weakness\n01 \u2713 \u2713 \u2013 \u2713 N/A\n02 \u2713 \u2713 \u2713 \u2718 Ambiguous identification G #\n03 \u2718 \u2713 \u2013 \u2713 Possible impersonation through name spoofing G #\n04 \u2713 \u2718 \u2013 \u2713 DNS hijacking G #\n05 \u2718 \u2718 \u2013 \u2713 Name spoofing, DNS hijacking G #\n06 \u2713 \u2718 \u2713 \u2718 DNS hijacking and ambiguous identification #\n07 \u2718 \u2718 \u2713 \u2718 Impersonation and DNS hijacking #\n08 \u2718 \u2713 \u2713 \u2718 Impersonation #\n09 \u2713 \u2713 \u2718 \u2718 Content poisoning #\n10 \u2713 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 DNS hijacking, content poisoning #\n11 \u2718 \u2713 \u2718 \u2718 Impersonation, content poisoning #\n12 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 \u2718 DNS hijacking, impersonation, content poisoning #\nassuring end users that the domain name owner has undergone\nsome form of vetting; at the same time, DNSSEC [ 7] compensates\nthe vulnerable client/server paradigm of DNS [ 12] and caters for\nauthenticated delegation and protect DNS data against tampering.\nTo authenticate the content provider behind a domain name X.509\ncertificates [ 26] are used. The semantics of a certificate depends\non its certification process: if the real-world entity behind a certifi-\ncate is vetted by a certification authority (CA) and is respectively\nawarded with an organization or extended validation certificate\n(OV/EV), the certificate can used for identification. Otherwise, if\nthe validation is limited to the ownership of a domain name, i.e.,do-\nmain validation (DV), the certificate is only good for authenticated\nconfidentiality and integrity.\nEMERGENCY COMMUNICATION\nEmergency communication is dependent on heightened security\nrequirements which are not always as relevant for other Internet\nservices ( e.g.,video streaming, social media). Three steps constitute\nour definition of secure online communication: ( i) securely authen-\nticating the authoritative service (\u201cidentification\u201d of the person,\norganization etc.behind the service name), ( ii) securely verifying\nthat users have not been misdirected and are transacting with the\nservice name they have identified (\u201cresolution\u201d of name to network\nservice), and ( iii) ensuring that the content was not altered, leaks\nprivacy etc.during the session (\u201ctransaction\u201d security). Although\ndifferent methods can be utilized to realize such a secure workflow,\nhere we focus on those technologies that are most accessible to\n(and deployable by) users and service operators in today\u2019s Internet,\nnamely the DNS and the Web PKI ecosystems. Alternative solutions\nare discussed in Section 8.\nAn illustrative example. For illustration of the communication\nworkflow and respective security pitfalls, we consider the simple\ncase of inquiring information about COVID-19 guidance as a resi-\ndent of Jackson County in Missouri. Through a search engine, an\nonline ad, a recommendation from friends, etc.the URL is quicklydiscovered: https://jacohd.org . When visiting the website, the\npresence of a green padlock in the address bar indicates only the\nconfidentiality and integrity of data exchange, but does not indicate\nwhether the website belongs to the supposed service ( i.e.,Health\nDepartment of Jackson County in Missouri instead of one of the\nother 22 Jackson Counties). The generic domain name could haven\nbeen registered and operated by anyone. An attacker could have\npublished a forged website implementing the look and feel of the\nreal health department. At no stage is the user given the chance to\nauthenticate the identity ( i.e.,identification) of the service provider\nbecause the provided DV certificate does not include any identifi-\ncation information. In contrast, the health department of Jackson\nCounty in Michigan is reachable under www.co.jackson.mi.us1.\nHere, the domain name under a restricted TLD indicates that it\nbelongs to Jackson County ( co.jackson ) in Michigan ( mi.us ), and\nthe accompanying EV certificate serves as a definitive proof of\nidentity.\nThreaten identification. In a secure setting, it would be possi-\nble to identify and authenticate the communication partner before\ninitiating the transaction. Yet, the point of departure for Web com-\nmunication are domain names, which cannot be used for secure\nidentification, while Web PKI certificates (as proofs of identity) are\nprovided only after resolution succeeds and transaction is initiated.\nThis implies that targeting authentic names and subsequent secure\nresolution are necessary (yet insufficient) conditions of identifi-\ncation through a certificate. Respectively, simple name spoofing,\ne.g.,through typosquatting [ 51], DNS cache poisoning [ 90], or other\nDNS hijacking attacks, which can mislead users to malicious ser-\nvices, can act as a precursor for impersonation attacks, especially if\nsubsequently only a DV certificate with no identity information is\npresented. A viable countermeasure is the use of restricted names-\npaces so at least the affiliation or identity of the service provider\ncan be inferred directly from its respective name. Governmental\norganizations in the US, for example, educate visitors that domain\nnames of federal government agencies most commonly end in .gov\n1The complete URL is https://www.co.jackson.mi.us/276/Health-Department .WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.\n1.

Subsequently, an OV/EV certificate provides direct ele-\nments of proof of identity. When considering using approaches like\nthis, exceptions may serve to help prove the rule: consider that the\nUnited States Post Office\u2019s (USPO\u2019s) official website is uspo. com ,\ni.e.,not under .gov . This, then, necessitates additional knowledge\nor verification before users of that government agency can be as-\nsured that they are transacting with the official authority online.\nProper identification, thus, involves both selection of proper do-\nmain names, secure resolution (see below), and identity information\nfrom OV/EV certificate.\nThreaten resolution. The second attack surface pertains to name\nresolution. There are two methods to assert that a name has been\nresolved correctly: either by using DNSSEC or through the X.509\nbindings in a certificate\u2019s common name (CN) or subject alternative\nnames (SAN). The latter approach, however, provides only an a pos-\nteriori assurance, i.e.,after transaction initiation with a server, and\nonly if the resolution has already succeeded correctly. Furthermore,\nespecially in case of DV certificates, if resolution is compromised,\ne.g.,through DNS poisoning, and as a result attackers were granted\na DV certificate (see Brandt et al. [14]), there is no way to verify\nthe integrity of the resolution process. The only effective solution\nin securing name resolution and deterring collateral damages such\nas DV certificate misissuances is deployment of DNSSEC.\nThreaten transaction. In the final step, after name identification\nand resolution, it is imperative to secure the transaction using\ntransport security protocols (TLS/SSL) in terms of authenticated\nconfidentiality and integrity. It is worth noting that authentication\n(using X.509 certificates) is crucial, because encryption and integrity\nchecks alone can also be performed by a malicious actor using\nmonkey-in-the-middle attacks.\nAssurance profiles. Based on threats on the three aforementioned\ndimensions, Table 1 provides the various combinations of DNS and\nWeb PKI options and the security implications of their deployment\nfor users; the Assurance Profiles summarizes their combinations.\nTo achieve strong assurance , a service provider should own a do-\nmain name that ( i) indicates its affiliation, ( ii) is securely delegated,\nand ( iii) is bound with a real-world entity through an OV/EV certifi-\ncate. A prominent example is coronavirus.gov which is registered\nunder .gov TLD denoting it being a governmental domain name,\nsupports DNSSEC ( i.e.,cannot be hijacked), and provides a valid\nOV certificate belonging to the Executive Office of the President .A service provider that only partially covers these aspects and\nfails to deploy DNSSEC or uses a name under a non-restricted\nnamespace exhibits a weak Assurance Profile due to susceptibility\nto DNS hijacking or simple name spoofing. This is how a campaign\nin Germany was able to defraud up to 4000 applicants of the corona\nrelief program of a federal state. The scammers spoofed the orig-\ninal domain name soforthilfe-corona.nrw.de by registering\nnrw-corona-soforthilfe.de without much burden because the\n.deTLD has no delegation restrictions that cannot be circumvented\nwith minimal effort. Although the authentic name (the former) was\nbound to a valid OV certificate, the spoofed name was awarded\nwith a DV certificate which gave the impression of authenticity\nand caused users to fell prey to this phishing campaign. Similarly,\nthe threat of DNS hijacking was highlighted during the pandemic\nas attackers managed to exploit a vulnerability in home routers\nand made use of insecure DNS to manipulate name resolution; an\nattack which could easily be defended through DNSSEC.\nIn contrast to the previous cases, inadequate assurance reflects\nthe case when no certificate or only a DV certificate is provided\nregardless of domain name properties and presence of DNSSEC.\nLack of a certificate at the very least defeats the purpose of au-\nthenticated encryption and integrity verification2, while a mere\nDV certificate can at best only cater to confidentiality and integrity\nwithout providing any information about the identity of service\nprovider. An example of weak assurance is the Corona Emergency\nResponse Fund of CDC foundation under give4cdcf.org which\nhave raised millions of dollars in fighting the pandemic. The usage\nof.org generic TLD simplifies name spoofing3, lack of DNSSEC\nmake it a suitable target for hijacking, and finally the provided DV\ncertificate practically doesn\u2019t provide any evidence of identity.\nThe subject of study in this paper are the US organizations involved\nin EM. Due to lack of a central registry, we focus on the list of Alert-\ning Authorities maintained by FEMA. Although this list might not\ninclude each and every entity involved in emergency management,\nit provides a decent, legitimate overview over this field comprising\na wide spectrum of organizations ranging from local governments,\nlaw enforcement agencies, and military bases to NGOs and universi-\nties. Each entry represents an organization by a unique ID, a name,\n2Considering that alternative SSL/TLS authentication methods, e.g.,pre-shared keys,\nare not scalable and suitable for studied cases here.\n3At the time of writing give4cdcf.net remains undelegated.Measuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia\nTable 2: Top-level domains in use by Alerting Authorities\nTLD Registration Registry Statistics\nType Label DNSSEC Restricted Fee/year Name Country Share Count DNSSEC\ngTLD.com \u2713 \u2718 < 15 $ Verisign US 19.44 % 258 2\n.org \u2713 \u2718 < 15 $ Public Internet Registry US 26.15 % 347 5\n.net \u2713 \u2718 < 15 $ Verisign US 4.37 % 58 0\n.info \u2713 \u2718 < 15 $ Afilias US 0.15 % 2 0\n50 % 665 7\nccTLD.cc \u2713 \u2718 < 15 $ eNIC1US 0.07 % 1 0\n.co \u2713 \u2718 < 20 $ .CO Internet S.A.S2US 0.07 % 1 0\n.us \u2713 (\u2713) < 15 $ Neustar US 4.89 % 65 0\n5.04 % 67 0\nccSLD .<code>.us (\u2713) \u2713 \u2013 Neustar US 17.71 % 235 2\nsTLD.edu \u2713 \u2713 77 $ Educase3US 0.45 % 6 0\n.gov \u2713 \u2713 400 $ General Services Administration US 25.92 % 344 30\n.mil \u2713 \u2713 \u2013 Defense Information Systems Agency US 0.75 % 10 10\n27.12 % 360 40\nUnique domain names 1327\n1subsidiary of Verisign,2subsidiary of Neustar,3operated by Verisign\nand a territory of operation (including unincorporated territories).\nThroughout this study, we use the AA list from September 11, 2019\ncomprising 1,388 entries (excluding a single duplicate entry).\nOur method consists of three phases: (1) preparation phase, (2)\ndomain namespace analysis, and (3) Web PKI analysis. Our mea-\nsurements were carried out from October 2019 up to March 2020\nwith each measurement being executed at least twice from vari-\nous vantage points in Europe and the US to detect any possible\nvantage point dependent discrepancies, e.g.,limited access due to\ngeo-blocking. Figure 2 summarizes our methodology from prepara-\ntion phase to data gathering and final analysis (see \u00a7 5 and \u00a7 6).\n(1) Preparation. In the preparation phase, we first retrieve and\nparse the AA list and assign the domain name used for web services\nfor each organization. To identify the primary website of an Alerting\nAuthority, we query and scrape the Google search engine. For each\nentry in the AA list, the combination of name and territory of\noperation ( e.g., Fresno Police Department CA ) was used as query\nstring. Each query yielded between 4 and 12 results. Since the\nresults are not necessarily ranked to have the official URL first, we\nexcluded results based on a list of inapt domain names ( e.g.,social\nmedia sites and yellow pages). The topmost remaining URL was\nthen selected for the respective organization. Finally, the list of\ncollected URLs was manually checked to remove any mismatches\nand falsely associated URLs which were not detected automatically,\ne.g.,same URL for homonymous counties in different states. A total\nof23entries were removed: 11entries with mismatched names,\n11associated with the wrong territory of operation, and 1with\nno matching URL at all; leaving a total of 1,365URLs for further\nanalysis. The remaining URLs ( e.g., https://www.fresno.gov/\npolice ) were parsed to extract the FQDNs ( e.g.,www.fresno.gov )\nand path segments ( e.g.,/police ).\n(2) Domain Namespace Analysis. In the second phase we first\nseparate effective second-level domains (SLD) from TLDs, e.g.,for\n\u2018www.ci.tracy.ca.us \u2019, \u2018ca.us \u2019 being the TLD (more specifically\nthe public suffix) and \u2018 tracy \u2019 the effective SLD. We then checkDNSSEC status for both the given domain name and its TLD, cate-\ngorize TLDs (restricted/unrestricted), and finally, based on a list of\npredefined keywords (see Table A.I in Appendix) map each Alerting\nAuthority to a field of activity as either Public safety, Governmen-\ntal, Law enforcement, Military, or Educational. The results of our\nanalysis on domains names is presented in Section 5.\n(3) Web PKI Analysis. Finally, domain names were used to inves-\ntigate the current and historic adaption of Web PKI certificates by\nrespective hosts. To study the current state, OpenSSL version 1.1.\n1dCLI was leveraged to fetch complete certificate chains, perform\nvalidation, and verify revocation status using stapled Online Certifi-\ncate Status Protocol (OCSP) [ 1], manual OCSP [ 78], or Certificate\nRevocation Lists (CRL) [ 26] (depending on availability). For our his-\ntorical analysis, we used CT logs [ 55,79]. To do this we leveraged\nthe publicly accessible database provided by Sectigo under crt.sh,\nwhich audits 79 log servers from 12 organizations (at the time of\nwriting). For any given host name, the database was queried for\ncertificates which have the host name or a wildcard covering the\nhost name as their subject name or have it included in the list of\nsubject alternative names (SAN). From a total of 28 ,370retrieved\nunique certificates, 10 ,826were pre-certificates and are omitted\nfrom further analysis. The remaining 17 ,544certificates were then\nlimited to those issued in the past decade (2009-2019), leaving a\ntotal number of 17 ,477certificates which are analyzed as described\nin Section 6.\nBy studying the domain names of alerting authorities, we aim to\nanswer the following questions:\n(1) Does each AA have its own dedicated domain name?\n(2) How do AAs integrate in the global DNS namespace?\n(3) Do AAs secure their names using DNSSEC?\nThe first question is concerned with how Alerting Authorities main-\ntain their online presence, and avoid unnecessary dependencies.\nLack of a dedicated name, for example, leads to dependence onWWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.\nsomeone else for authentication and data security as X.509 certifi-\ncates are bound to domain names. The second question aims to\ninvestigate whether AAs prefer specific TLDs to take advantages of\nrecognizability ( e.g.,governmental organization under .gov ) and\nsecurity (restricted vs. non-restricted TLDs). Finally, the last ques-\ntion regards measures taken in securing names against threats such\nas spoofing or DNS hijacking which can also lead to impersonation\nand phishing. Table 2 summarizes our findings.\nWe consider an AA to have a dedicated DNS name either if it has\nits own effective SLD, or has been assigned a sub-domain under\nthe namespace of its parenting organization or any generic service\nprovider, which is not shared. For example, the Tehama County Sher-\niff(tehamaso.org ) has its own dedicated name whereas Apache\nCounty Sheriffs Office (www.co.apache.az.us/sheriff/ ) does not.\nTo measure dedicated domain names we divided the set of AA\nURLs into two groups depending on whether the URL path segment\nis empty (674 entries) or not (691 entries); the group with empty\npath segments was then regarded as having dedicated names. To\nprevent false positives of non-dedicated names, we manually ex-\namined all these websites and verified that the landing page does\nnot relate to the Alerting Authority. We found only 25 false pos-\nitives ( e.g., http://www.franklincountyema.org/db/ with /db\npath being the start page), which leads to overall \u224851% AAs with\ndedicated names while the rest represents common names of parent\norganizations or other service providers. We also observed three\nemergency management agencies with dedicated names which are\nredirected (using HTTP 301/302 response codes) to web pages un-\nder county or state websites. Out of the total 1,365 collected URLs\n1,327 unique domain names exist, showing that in some cases mul-\ntiple entities are subsumed under the same domain, e.g.,different\nagencies all under the domain name of a single state.\nThe data also shows that all educational entities (total of 4) and\nover 90% of governmental entities (467 out of 503) such as state\nand local governments own dedicated names in contrast to only\n\u224825% of public safety entities (164 out of 669), and less than half of\nmilitary organizations (8 out of 19) which nearly all are represented\nunder home.army.mil .\nWe start with various TLDs and country code second-level domains\n(ccSLDs) in use by Alerting Authorities, which we group as follows:\ngTLD [48]: generic top-level domain, e.g.,.org\nccTLD [47]: country code top-level domain, e.g.,.us\nccSLD [49]: country code second-level domain, e.g.,.ny.us\nsTLD [50]: sponsored top-level domain, e.g.,.mil\nEach TLD group features different properties. In general, there are\nlittle to no delegation limits and naming conventions for names\nunder gTLDs or ccTLDs except for the .usnamespace. Under .us\nccTLD more than 3,000 names are reserved and unavailable for pub-\nlic registration [ 61] and the namespace has a rigorous structure with\ndomain names at second, third, or fourth levels. This structuring\nreflects the \u201cpolitical geography\u201d [ 25] and defines a number of re-\nserved names for designated organizations or purposes, e.g.,county\nor city, and territory of operation [ 25,62].

It is noteworthy that the .uslocality namespace exhibits\na relatively low penetration among AAs. For example, the usage\nof canonical forms [ci,co].<locality>.<state-code>.us for\ncities or counties: we observe that for every 5 cities which have the\nterm cityin their domain names there exists only 1 city which uses\nthe foreseen naming pattern, and for every 4 counties choosing to\nhave the term county in its domain name, there is only one county\nopting for the canonical form.\nFinally, we examined if the specific choice of top-level domains\nfor an organization correlates with the organization\u2019s field of opera-\ntion. Figure 3 depicts how widespread various TLD types are in use\nin different fields of operation. It is noteworthy that educational\nand military organizations make exclusive use of restricted TLDs\n(.edu and .mil respectively), whereas gTLDs remain the more\npopular choice among the others. This figure also confirms the\nprevious observations that the majority of remaining organizations,\nregardless of field of operation, opt for generic TLDs instead of\ntaking advantage of special namespaces within the well-organized\nstructured of .usnamespace.\nWe used drill to chase DNS signatures and verify if a domain has\nproperly activated DNSSEC. All TLDs in use by AAs (see Table 2)\nsupport DNSSEC except a number of .usccSLD domains: out of 50\ntotal state ccSLDs under .usnamespace, 32 have been used by AA\norganizations with only 18 supporting DNSSEC.

Compared with the\nlongitudinal DNSSEC study of Chung et al. [ 22], measuring 0.6%\nfor.com and 1.0%for.org domains, we observe a higher DNSSEC\npenetration. However, to our surprise even among .gov SLDs which\nare mandated to implement DNSSEC [ 66] less than 10% (30) have\nsupport for DNSSEC which is considerably less than the \u224890%\nDNSSEC penetration among select governmental organizations\n(sample set of ca. 1200 .gov SLDs) as measured by NIST [63].\nThe ecosystem of Web PKI revolves around X.509 certificates. We\ninvestigate the deployment and characteristics of certificates in the\ncontext of Alerting Authorities to answer the following questions:\n(1) To what extent do AAs adapt web PKI?\n(2)How is the historic landscape of X.509 shaped among AAs?\nTo have a better understanding of the current deployment of web\ncertificates, we gathered a snapshot of SSL/TLS deployment on\npublic servers of Alerting Authorities.\nOut of the total 1327 unique names, 1187 hosts ( \u224889%) support\nSSL/TLS with 1130 hosts ( \u224895%) delivering valid X.509 certificates.\nWithin the remaining 57 hosts, 17 use expired certificates, 9 use self-\nsigned certificates, and 1 has self-signed certificates in its certificate\nchain. The validity of certificates provided by the remaining 30 hosts\ncould not be verified due to some kind of misconfiguration, e.g.,use\nof invalid certificates or certificates with missing issuer information.\nRecall that we use OpenSSL trusted root certificates for validation.\nCompared with other Web PKI studies we see in our focused sample\nof AA organizations relatively less invalid certificates compared\nto global average of 65%as observed by Chung et al. [ 21] over the\nIPv4 space in 2016, or \u224813%as measured by Durumeric et al.

Due to low\npenetration of DNSSEC, popularity of open TLDs, and pervasive-\nness of DV certificates among AAs (\u00a7 5), only about 22% of AA are\nconsidered to be equipped against common threats to trustworthy\ncommunication.\n6.2 Historic X.509 Certificate Landscape\nThe historic analysis of X.509 certificates collected from Certificate\nTransparency logs (see Section 4) helps us to gain a better under-\nstanding of security policy changes related to Alerting Authorities\nand CAs. We span ten years. It should be noted that the total num-\nber of organizations with publicly logged certificates changes for\neach year. We consider this in the following and normalize the\nresults either with respect to the number of organizations or total\nnumber of certificates valid per year.\n6.2.1 Certificate Authorities. In addition to common regulations,\ncertificate authorities implement and follow their own set of policies.\nFrom the perspective of relying parties, i.e.,web users, such policies\nare opaque and as long as a CA is included in a user\u2019s trust store,\nit is considered trustworthy. For the subscribers, however, these\npolicies among other factors such as fees, offered certificate types,\nand operation costs are decisive in choosing an appropriate CA.\nWe focus our analysis on the list of top CAs with an average\ncoverage of yearly 20 unique AA subscribers (hosts) in the last\ndecade. We use the term cover to differentiate from issuance: if a\nhost, for example, is issued a certificate by a CA valid from 2010 to\n2013, we consider this host to be covered by that CA for 2010, 2011,\n2012, and 2013. Respectively, if a CA issues multiple short-lived\ncertificates ( e.g.,90 days) for a host within a given year, we only\ncount that host as covered once in that year by the issuing CA. This\nwould avoid the data skew in favor of issuers with lower certificate\nvalidity windows and higher certification rate per year. It also\nshould be noted that a single host can have certificates issued from\ndifferent CAs. Figure 5 depicts these findings in terms of relative\nmarket share development in the past decade (see Table A.II in\nAppendix for details). Compared with the CA market share for the\nAlexa 1M top domain list throughout the last last decade [ 2,28,45]\nwe observe parallels, such as decline of GoDaddy\u2019s market share\nand rapid gains of Let\u2019s Encrypt, as well as discrepancies that cannot\ndirectly be explained due to dynamic nature of and fluctuations in\nthe Alexa top list.WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.\n\u201909 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u20191902040\nYearMarket Share (%)Comodo DigiCert Entrust GeoTrust\nGoDaddy LetsEncrypt Sectigo Verisign\nFigure 5: Market share of top CAs in the past decade\n\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918\u2019190204060DV\nOV\nEV\nYearShare (%)\n(a) Certificate types\n\u201909\u201910\u201911\u201912\u201913\u201914\u201915\u201916\u201917\u201918\u201919/C\u00fercle\n/LEFTCIRCLE /C\u00fercle\n/CIRCLE\nYear (b) Assurance profiles\nFigure 6: Development of certificate types and assurance pro-\nfiles (\u00a73) in the past decade\nFigure 5 also highlights two factors evidently decisive for AAs\nin their choice of CA: convenience and cost factors. GoDaddy, for\nexample, which has been the market leader among AAs for about\ntwo thirds of the past decade, provides web hosting and domain\nname registration beside certification services in convenient pack-\nages; and Let\u2019s Encrypt, which has surged to the top in the short\nperiod after its public offering, offers automated DV certification at\nno cost.\n6.2.2 Validation types and assurance profiles. In Section 6.1, we\nshowed that currently only about 22% of AAs honor security profiles\nthat are resilient against threats to trustworthy communication (see\nTables 3 and 4). Historically, however, as depicted in Figure 6, a\nhigher share of alerting authorities provisioned for such measures.\nWhen compared with the share of various certificate validation\ntypes (DV, OV, and EV), it becomes evident how the decreasing\nusage of OV certificates is directly proportional to the reduction of\npreferred assurance profiles. At the same time the surging popu-\nlarity of DV certificates has led to an increase in cases of what we\nconsider as inadequately trustworthy (no identification). It should\nbe noted that as our partial historical DNSSEC penetration statis-\ntics (collected through SecSpider4[67]), covering\u224825%of studied\nhosts, exhibits negligible fluctuation in DNSSEC penetration, we\nmade a simple assumption that historic support for DNSSEC among\nAAs equals to its current penetration state (see Section 5.3).\n6.2.3 Certificate Sharing. Except EV certificates, both DV and OV\ncertificates allow wildcard names as subject alternative names (SAN)\n4https://secspider.net\n\u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u201919051015\nYearShare (%)DNS SAN (#) (10,50] (50,100] (100,)Figure 7: Share of host names represented by certificates\nwith more than 10 unique SAN entries\nto avoid enumerating all FQDNs under the control of the certifi-\ncate holder. In practice, the SAN extension also allows sharing a\ncertificate among different hosts. For example, In 2019 the federal\ngovernment was issued OV certificates with more than 600 SAN\nentries each. Certificate sharing expands the attack surface and in-\ncreases operational costs since if one of the hosts is compromised or\nthe certificate is revoked, every other host also need to configured\nwith a new certificate (sometimes called \u201cfate-sharing\u201d).\nMultitenancy web hosting and security service providers (both\npublic or government exclusive) are making use of shared certifi-\ncates as depicted in Figure 7. It is worth noting that Let\u2019s Encrypt\ncertificates only allow up to 100 DNS type SANs. In our analysis,\nwe also noticed an increasing number of certificate sharing among\nhosts which do not belong to the same logical entity. Most criti-\ncally also among OV certificates where a service provider obtains a\ncertificate under its name and lists the host name of its customers\nas SAN, practically defeating the identification purpose of the cer-\ntificate. At the time of writing, for example, we observe cases of\nsuch certificates listing SANs that obviously belong to separate enti-\nties, e.g.,mo.gov ,asap.farm , and incapsula.com under the same\ncertificate. In this very specific case, records from the Wayback\nMachine archives show that asap.farm has previously belonged\nto Missouri Department of Agriculture [ 65] but it was never re-\nmoved from the certificate as the domain name registration was\ntransferred to another entity.\n6.2.4 Certificate Validity. A certificate is presumed valid if, among\nothers, it is deployed within its validity period, is issued by a trust-\nworthy CA, carries a valid signature, is bound to the correct subject\nname, and is not revoked (see RFC 5280 [ 26]). Checking revocation\nstatus often requires network transactions, and is the most expen-\nsive operation among aforementioned factors. Thus in many cases it\nis either performed inadequately or ignored altogether by browsers\n(partly in favor of proprietary solutions) [ 57]. Consequently, in the\npast years both CAs and browser vendors have been negotiating to\ncap and reduce certificate lifetimes [ 38\u201340] as an effort to reduce\nsecurity risks due to misissued or revoked certificates.\nAs depicted in Figure 8, the lifetime of certificates utilized by\nAAs has been constantly decreasing. This trend can partly be at-\ntributed to consensus among CAs and browser vendors to reduce\ncertificate lifetimes, but also due to rising popularity of CAs which\nare specialized on free and automated DV certificates such as Let\u2019s\nEncrypt (fixed lifetime of 90 days). The median validity periods that\nwe observe here are comparable with related works [ 21,28], yetMeasuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia\n\u201909 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 \u20191901,0002,000\nYearLifetime (days)\nFigure 8: Validity distribution of logged certificates per year\nthere are no recent studies that can corroborate the sharp decrease\nin validity periods from 2015 on.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigat-\ning how Alerting Authorities in the US (as part of broader critical\ninfrastructure) implement measures to cater for trustworthy Web-\nbased communication and service provision. Previous research on\ntrust in online emergency service provision mainly focuses on\nform and content and its relation to the perception of trustworthi-\nness [ 17,29,46], conception of trustworthy emergency communica-\ntion and collaboration systems [ 18,69] or simply best practices in\nbuilding trust [ 10,58]. Although previous research has already high-\nlighted how knowing who is behind an online emergency service\nimpacts the trustworthiness of their respective services [ 29,58,70],\nwe observe a research gap when it comes to evaluating the mea-\nsures at one\u2019s disposal to reach this goal. More specifically, the\ninterplay of characteristics of domain names and X.509 certificates,\ni.e.,Assurance Profile (Section 3). has not been investigated to our\nbest knowledge. Respectively, we limit ourselves to an overview of\nrelated work which studies these technologies on their own.\nDomain Namespace and DNSSEC. The influence of a domain\nname on authenticating or at least recognizing the real-world en-\ntity behind that name has been investigated in terms of general\ntrustworthiness associated with TLDs and impersonation of trusted\nentities through domain name masquerading. Walther, Wang, and\nLoh [ 88] examine how choice of TLD can positively impact the\ncredibility of health websites. Seckler et al. [81] investigate how a\nrelevant domain name, e.g.,a known TLD, can positively enforce\nfamiliarity and in turn increase trust. Similarly, a yearly report [ 37]\ncommissioned by the Public Internet Registry examines the trust-\nworthiness of select TLDs among NGO donors.\nA closely related topic is how the domain namespace of malicious\nwebsites is structured and operated. Korczynski et al. [53] show\nhow low pricing and registration barriers alongside the possibility\nof bulk registration is an enabler for malicious actors to migrate to\nnew gTLDs. In a longitudinal study of typosquatting, Agten et al. [4]\nreveals how registration fees and registry policies can attract or\ndeter malicious actors; practically determining the credibility of\nsuch TLDs (the top three most abused TLDs in the world are new\ngTLDs [ 72]). And Antonakakis et al. [6] introduce a reputation\nsystem for DNS to detect malicious domain names. Different studies\nshow how scammers try to impersonate other entities by partly\nor fully integrating legitimate domain names in their own domainnames [ 4,52,75,86] or even by using homonymous names using\ninternationalized domain names [85].\nWith regard to namespace security, studies in the past pinpoint a\nrelatively low DNSSEC penetration due to various factors ranging\nfrom lack of support by local resolvers to server misconfigura-\ntions [ 22,42,56,68] despite more than 90% of all TLDs being signed\nand supporting DNSSEC [ 74]. The prevalence of DNSSEC among\nvarious types of organizations, such as educational, military, com-\nmercial, etc.has not been subject of study to determine if there is a\ncorrelation between field of operation and sensibility for DNS secu-\nrity measures. The only exception is the fine-grained, i.e.,including\nsecond level domains, regular analysis of DNSSEC deployment\namong select governmental agencies within the .gov namespace,\neducational institutions, and industry in the US [63, 77].\nWeb PKI. Throughout the years, various measurements have\ncharacterized X.509 certificates in use over the Internet in terms of\nvalidity, issuing CAs, key strength, etc.[21,28,45,60]. Among these,\nMishari et al. [60] investigate the difference between certificates of\nlegitimate and fraudulent websites. The study by Holz et al. [45]\nhas the advantage of being performed from different vantage points\nspread over the world. The measurements by Durumeric et al. [28]\nis noteworthy as it goes beyond mere X.509 certificate analysis and\ninvestigates the dependencies among root and intermediate CAs,\ntheir market share, and the characteristics of respective certificates.\nAnd finally, the measurements performed by Chung et al. [21] aim\nto understand why a majority of certificates advertised over IPv4\nare invalid. It should be noted that except the last study, the oth-\ners have been carried out before major changes in the Web PKI\noccurred, such as various mergers and the public launch of Let\u2019s En-\ncrypt [ 2]. Furthermore, the findings from these studies exhibit dif-\nferent characteristics of sample sets, which are either too limited\n(e.g.,Alexa Top 1M) or too broad ( e.g.,IPv4 space). Those differ-\nences do not allow for statistical inference and comparison with\nour observations.\nIn a recent study, which is most closely related to our work, Sin-\nganamalla et al. [83] measure the adoption of https at government\nwebsites. Using primarily an automated, keyword-based matching\nto collect domain names this approach is prone to false positives\nand makes comparison to our work infeasible. Also, this work does\nnot relate to Assurance Profiles, which we introduce in our study.\nSpecifically related to the topic of our work are studies which\ninvestigate the trustworthiness of CAs in general and their policies\nspecially in enabling fraud and impersonation. Delignat-Lavaud et\nal.[27], for example, investigate the conformance of CAs to the\nCA/Browser Forum guidelines, which in turn can influence trust-\nworthiness of a CA. Others have defined various metrics to qual-\nify [19,30] or quantify trustworthiness of CAs [ 43] beyond technical\nmeasures. In a recent study Schwittmann, Wander and Weis [ 80],\nsimilar to Brandt et al. [14], exhibit how various CAs are susceptible\nto attacks on DV certification processes that can practically lead to\ndomain impersonation. Roberts et al. [75] studies which CAs are re-\nsponsible for issuing DV certificates to malicious target-embedded\ndomains.WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.\nOur results draw a rather alarming picture of the current online\nemergency management landscape regarding trustworthy commu-\nnication. Along the line of our key findings, we discuss the possible\nreasons for the observed deficiencies and suggest alternatives.\nOnly about 22% of AAs deploy sufficient identification. Iden-\ntification, as discussed in Section 3, succeeds over multiple factors,\nwhich are only insufficiently attended to by AAs: only about half of\nAAs have their dedicated names and as such cannot obtain exclusive\nX.509 certificates as proof of identity (as these are bound to domain\nnames) while a majority of \u224878%fail to provide any valid certifi-\ncate or just DV certificates which lack identification information.\nThe majority of organizations opt for generic TLDs which simpli-\nfies name spoofing and phishing as precursors of impersonation.\nAdditionally, the minuscule penetration rate of DNSSEC provides\nanother attack surface by poisoning DNS records and misdirecting\nusers to malicious websites. Alerting Authorities should at best\nbe located under restricted namespaces as an additional factor of\nrecognizably and assurance, have at least their own subdomains\ninstead of being subsumed in the path segment of a URL, secure\ntheir namespace using DNSSEC, and provide OV/EV certificates as\ndefinitive proof of identity.\nLess than 4% of AAs offer secure name resolution. Securing\ndomain names is seemingly a non-priority for investigated organi-\nzations as the low penetration rate of DNSSEC suggests. Insecure\nDNS not only can cause misdirection from authentic websites, but\nalso DV certificate misissuance [ 14,80] which impacts both identi-\nfication and session security. Although DNSSEC suffers low deploy-\nment on the global scale in general, it is an indispensable component\nin securing emergency communication as part of the broader crit-\nical infrastructure. Yet, it should be noted that in some cases due\nto lack of support registrants are forced to abandon DNSSEC in\nfavor of other factors, e.g.,registering under a .uslocality name for\nwhich there is, surprisingly, no DNSSEC support (see Figure 4). We\nalso note that although domain names under .gov namespaces are\nmandated to use DNSSEC [ 66], the low support for DNSSEC has\nits roots in operational and organizational mismanagement rather\nthan technical issues.\nDV certificates dominate transaction security. The popularity\nof domain validation certificates combined with low penetration\nof DNSSEC represents an attack surface that can compromise ses-\nsion security through certificate missisuance and monkey-in-the-\nmiddle attacks. If DV is indispensable for some, we encourage the\nstakeholders to reconsider semantically equivalent alternative of\nTLSA domain issued certificates (DANE EE) as they provide higher\nresilience against spoofing in contrast to DV certificates [ 80]. In\ngeneral, DANE can be used to remove ambiguity regarding public\nkeys and responsible CAs for a domain name [67].\nFate-sharing is on the rise. The lack of dedicated domain names\nand an increase of certificate sharing in multitenancy settings rep-\nresents worrisome and de facto unnecessary dependencies, which\nboth can expand the attack surface [ 67] and can cause instabilities\nin the future. Regarding shared certificates, we suggest abandoningthem completely and also encourage CAs to avoid issuing OV cer-\ntificates for service providers without ensuring that all the listed\nsubject alternative names belong to the same organization.\nConvenience and cost impact security preferences. We ob-\nserve 15% of AAs providing none or invalid certificates. This can\nbe traced back to carelessness regarding the Web PKI trust model\n(self-signed certificates) or additional (not only financial) configu-\nration [ 54] and certification costs. Rapid growth of Let\u2019s Encrypt\nwith its fully automated certificate issuance and renewal is an in-\ndication of how the aforementioned factors influence the decision\nfor choosing an appropriate CA. Similarly, we measure less than\n45% represented under restricted namespaces. In contrast to gTLDs,\nhigher registration fees or bureaucratic hurdles, and longer del-\negation processing times are among discouraging factors, which\ncall for governmental support and can effectively be addressed\nby policy-makers through price caps and easier access for eligible\norganizations which fulfill the strict requirements.\nResponsibilities beyond Alerting Authorities. The scope of\ntrustworthy communication goes beyond our investigations and ex-\ntends to consumers as well as infrastructure operators such as CAs,\nISPs, and browser vendors. There is still a gap between CA practices\nand guidelines [ 27], some automated DV certification services are\nsusceptible to impersonation attacks [ 75,80], and some root CAs do\nnot restrict certification scope for their intermediate CAs [ 28]. DNS\nregistrars not always offer DNSSEC by default or free of cost [ 23]\nand only a minority of ISPs bother to operate DNSSEC-aware re-\ncursive resolvers that properly verify signed DNS records [22, 89].\nBrowser vendors should also provide better security usability by\navoiding confusing SSL/TLS warnings [ 5], improve instead of aban-\ndoning visual cues for different certificate types [ 32,44,64], and\nstart offering alternative CA trustworthiness assessment measures\nbeyond the standard binary trust model [ 19,30,43]. Finally, users\nshould be educated in better understanding the semantics of do-\nmain names [ 76] and web PKI certificates and their practical use\nand ramifications.\nIn this paper, we conceptualized a threat model for trustworthy\ncommunication in emergency management and analyzed the lack of\ncommon technologies, DNS(SEC) and Web PKI, to mitigate threats\nto identification, resolution, and content manipulation or eavesdrop-\nping. We provided an overview of how Alerting Authorities (AA)\nin the US are structured within the domain namespace, how wide-\nspread is DNSSEC in securing their domain names, and how Web\nPKI is used for authentication and data security. We uncovered\ndeficiencies and discussed alternatives while emphasizing that re-\nspective solutions are not necessarily technical but operational as\nwell as political. Protecting critical infrastructure for emergency\ncommunication and public safety entails addressing operational\nand policy challenges on national and international levels and calls\nfor commitment of all stakeholders from service providers to inter-\nmediate infrastructure operators and browser vendors alongside\npolicy-makers.\nIn the future, this work can be extended beyond the US territory\nwhile providing a comparison basis for other countries. Further-\nmore, other technologies can be accommodated in our assuranceMeasuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW \u201921, April 19\u201323, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia\nprofiles. Finally, the role of intermediate infrastructure and further\ndependency structures can be investigated in depth.\nData Disclosure.
