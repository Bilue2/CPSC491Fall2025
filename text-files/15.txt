Dear Mr. Whiteley-Ross,
The Federal Communications Commission received OCHIN, Inc.’s November 10, 2022 notice of 
withdrawal from the Connected Care Pilot Program.  By this letter, we confirm OCHIN, Inc.’swithdrawal from the Program.  If there are any questions regarding this withdrawal confirmation, please contact ConnectedCare@fcc.gov .  Thank you for your interest in the Connected Care Pilot Program.
Sincerely,

Re: Connected Care Pilot Program Application No. CCPP20200000030  Dear Chief Griffin, 
 
As the Chief Financial Officer at OCHIN, Inc. I am  writing this letter to formally withdraw my 
organization’s pilot project from the Connected Care Pilot Program. 
 I thank the Commission for its ongoing partnership wi th OCHIN and our consortia of participating health 
centers across the United States. The FCC has been inst rumental in partnering with us to connect rural 
health care providers with subsidized medical-grade broadband service through the Healthcare Connect 
Fund Program , and providing community health centers acro ss the country with telehealth technologies 
that connect underserved communities to health care  in the wake of a global pandemic through the 
COVID-19 Telehealth Program .  
 As you know, in January 2021, the Commission also se lected OCHIN to administer up to $5.8 million on 
behalf of a consortium of members to directly subsidize internet services to patient homes in Ohio, 
Oregon, and Washington states through the Connected Care Pilot Program . Following a period of 
analysis and discussion with your attorney advisory team, we have made the hard decision to withdraw 
from the program. Despite both OCHIN and the FCC’ s desire and efforts to find a workable solution, 
unfortunately we are not able to move the project forward.  
 This program was authorized during the worst of the pandemic, and community health care has since 
pivoted. Health care institutions have changed drasti cally to accommodate today’s reality, with precious 
provider capacity directed to preserving patient access in a contracting economy. Accordingly, OCHIN’s anchor health care providers have encountered opera tional barriers and limited capacity to implement 
this pilot project according to the Connected Care Pilot Program’s complex requirements.  
 On OCHIN’s behalf I express our sincere gratitude for th e Commission’s selection of our pilot project. We 
continue to be committed to advancing the critical  digital equity work of FCC programs through our 
long-standing consortia efforts. We look forward to  sharing our learnings in supporting rural, tribal, 
frontier, and safety net providers and continuing our successful partnership with the FCC. If we can ever 
be of assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.   Respectfully,    
 y

PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELAND SECURITY BUREAU OPENS THE EAS TEST 
REPORTING SYSTEM FOR FILINGS
PS Docket No. 15-94
The Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau) provides notice that the EAS Test 
Reporting System (ETRS) is now available to accept Form One filings.  As stated in the Bureau’s 
recently released Public Notice, EAS Participants must file their ETRS Form One on or before February 
28, 2023.1  Pursuant to Section 11.61 of the Commission’s rules, EAS Participants must renew their 
identifying information required by ETRS Form One on a yearly basis.2  
I. FILING INFORMATION
A. ETRS Login and Weblinks
Filers can access ETRS by visiting the ETRS page of the Commission’s website at 
https://www.fcc.gov/general/eas-test-reporting-system.3  Filers must use their registered FCC Username 
(Username) that is associated with the FCC Registration Numbers (FRNs) for which they will file.  Filers 
that have already created a Username for use with another FCC system may access the ETRS with that 
Username.  Filers that do not remember the password that corresponds with their Username may reset it at 
https://apps2.fcc.gov/fccUserReg/pages/reset-passwd-identify.htm.  Filers that have not previously 
created a Username may do so by visiting the User Registration System at 
https://apps2.fcc.gov/fccUserReg/pages/createAccount.htm.  Filers can associate their Username to an 
FRN by logging in at https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/userLogin.do and clicking on the appropriate option.  
Additional information regarding creating and associating FRNs with a Username can be found on the 
CORES FAQs page at https://apps.fcc.gov/cores/publicHome.do?faq=true&csfrToken=.
B. Excepted Filers
All EAS Participants – including Low Power FM stations (LPFM), Class D non-commercial 
educational FM stations, and EAS Participants that are silent pursuant to a grant of Special Temporary 
Authority – are required to register and file in ETRS, with the following exceptions:  Analog and digital 
low power television (LPTV) stations that operate as television broadcast translator stations, FM 
broadcast booster stations and FM translator stations that entirely rebroadcast the programming of other 
local FM broadcast stations, and analog and digital broadcast stations that operate as satellites or repeaters 
of a hub station (or common studio or control point if there is no hub station) and rebroadcast 100 percent 
of the programming of the hub station (or common studio or control point) are not required to register and

One in the EAS Test Reporting System, Public Notice, DA 22-1330 (rel. Dec. 15, 2022).  See also 47 CFR 
§§ 11.2(b), 11.11(a) (defining and listing categories of EAS Participants).
2 See 47 CFR § 11.61(a)(3)(iv)(A).  
3 Instructional videos regarding registration and completion of the ETRS Form One are also available on the ETRS 
website.
3Federal Communications Commission DA 23-1
file in ETRS.  However, the hub station (or common studio or control point) is required to register and 
file in ETRS.4
C. Miscellaneous Filing Information
Filers can update previously filed forms in ETRS by clicking on the “My Filings” menu option 
and then clicking on the record for that form.  Broadcasters can pre-populate Form One by completing the 
FRN and Facility ID fields.  Cable systems can pre-populate Form One by completing the FRN and 
Physical System ID (PSID) fields.  EAS Participants that pre-populate Form One using a Facility ID 
number or a PSID number are urged to review their pre-populated data to ensure accuracy.  
Each EAS Participant should file a separate copy of Form One for each of its EAS decoders, EAS 
encoders, or units combining such decoder and encoder functions.  For example, if an individual is filing 
for a broadcaster (or cable headend) that uses two units combining decoder and encoder functions, that 
individual should file two copies of Form One.  
The Bureau urges EAS Participants to review Form One as soon as possible to allow sufficient 
time for possible corrections.  EAS Participants are allowed thirty days after submission to submit any 
updates or corrections to their filings.5  
II. FURTHER ASSISTANCE

Advisor, Policy and Licensing Division, Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, at (202) 418-0011 
or maureen.bizhko@fcc.gov.   
Filers may contact FCC Licensing Support for assistance with creating a Username or other

through Friday (except Federal holidays).  Filers may contact Bureau staff for assistance with ETRS 
filings via ETRS@fcc.gov.

(TLBC) construction requirement to deploy service to the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma communities in 
Eastern Oklahoma (Choctaw Nation communities).  For the reasons stated below, we grant a limited 
waiver of section 1.2110(f)(3)(vii) to provide one additional year for Pine Cellular to meet the TLBC 
construction requirement associated with Call Sign WRAM805, one of its 600 MHz licenses.
II. BACKGROUND
2. Pine Cellular was the winning bidder in Auction No. 1002 for two 600 MHz licenses, 
including the Texarkana, TX (PEA 181) E-Block license that is the subject of this Third Extension 
Request.1  On January 9, 2018, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) issued Pine Cellular’s 
license for this market, Call Sign WRAM805, which included a TLBC of $2,009,350 to serve the 
Choctaw Nation communities.2  As a condition of receiving the TLBC, Pine Cellular was initially 
required to construct and operate a system capable of serving 75 percent of the population of the Choctaw 
Nation communities within the relevant service area within three years of the license grant, by January 9, 
2021.3  
3.Supply Chain Proceeding.  In November 2019, the Commission adopted a rule to 
prospectively prohibit recipients from using USF funds “to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, modify, 
or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by any company posing a national 
security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain”4 
(covered companies), and initially designated Huawei Technologies Company (Huawei) and ZTE

Corporation (ZTE) as covered companies for purposes of this rule.5  In June 2020, the Public Safety and 
Homeland Security Bureau issued final designations of Huawei and ZTE as covered companies, effective 
immediately.6  In the Supply Chain Second Report and Order,7 the Commission promulgated rules for the 
Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (Reimbursement Program) to 
reimburse eligible providers of advanced communications service for costs reasonably incurred in the 
removal, replacement, and disposal of communications equipment/services.8  The Supply Chain Third 
Report and Order, adopted on July 13, 2021, amended the rules for the Reimbursement Program to be 
consistent with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, passed on December 27, 2020.9  
4.Initial Extension Request.  On May 22, 2020, Pine Cellular filed its Initial Extension 
Request,10 which sought a waiver of section 1.2110(f)(3)(vii) to allow for additional time to meet the 
TLBC construction requirement.11  Pine Cellular explained that, when its license was issued in January 
2018, it already had wireless mobile infrastructure in place and was well-positioned to deploy service to 
the Choctaw Nation communities within the three-year period.12  Soon after Pine Cellular’s license was 
issued, however, the Commission initiated the Supply Chain proceeding and later adopted the rule to 
prospectively prohibit use of USF funds to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, modify, or otherwise 
support any equipment or services produced or provided by covered companies.13  Pine Cellular receives 
high-cost support from the Commission’s Mobility Fund Phase I and Connect America Fund Phase II 
programs, and Pine Cellular is an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier.14  Pine Cellular asserted that it 
needed additional time to deploy its network to serve the Choctaw Nation communities because its 
existing network in that geographic area uses Huawei equipment for the performance of core functions.15

Extension of Time to Satisfy the Construction Requirement (filed May 22, 2020) (Initial Extension Request).
11 See generally Initial Extension Request.
12 Id. at 12-13.  In this request, Pine Cellular stated that it “planned to enhance [its] infrastructure by constructing 
approximately 20 new antenna sites, and adding a number of new remote radio heads, at a cost of approximately $1 
million, to utilize the 600 MHz spectrum.”  Id. at 12.
13 See Supply Chain Notice; 47 CFR § 54.9; Supply Chain Order.  In adopting the rule, the Commission initially 
designated Huawei as one of the covered companies for purposes of the rule.  Id.; see also 47 CFR § 54.9(b).  In 
June 2020, the determination that Huawei is a covered company was made final, effective immediately.  See Huawei 
Designation Order.

5. Specifically, because Pine Cellular is prohibited from using USF funds to maintain, 
improve, modify, operate, manage, or otherwise support its Huawei equipment,16 it asserted that it could 
not act without a significant cost burden until the Commission acted in the Supply Chain proceeding to 
establish a cost reimbursement program for USF recipients to replace equipment from covered 
companies.17  Further, Pine Cellular argued, if it did expand its existing Huawei network it faced penalties 
if it could not prove to the Commission’s satisfaction that it used non-USF funds.18  As a result, Pine 
Cellular claimed that it was unreasonable to build out its existing network in the area to serve the 
Choctaw Nation communities at that time.19  Pine Cellular asserted that imposition of the rule would have 
been inequitable and unduly burdensome, and given the complications with construction, Pine Cellular 
had no reasonable alternative.20  Pine Cellular sought a construction extension to “a date not earlier than 
eighteen (18) months after the Commission adopts a Report and Order based upon the Supply Chain 
Further Notice.”21  On October 1, 2020, the Bureau partially granted Pine Cellular’s request, extending 
the construction deadline by one year to January 9, 2022.22
6.Second Extension Request.  On July 27, 2021, Pine Cellular filed its Second Extension 
Request, which sought waiver of section 1.2110(f)(3)(vii) to allow Pine Cellular an additional year to 
meet its TLBC construction requirement.23  Pine Cellular explained that its TLBC construction progress 
had been affected by the continued development of the Reimbursement Program and uncertainty as to 
what extent it would be reimbursed for costs associated with its removal of Huawei equipment it installed 
before June 30, 2020, if it took action before it could participate in the Reimbursement Program.24  Pine 
Cellular also stated that, in order to meet the extended January 9, 2022 deadline, it would have to 
complete a significant number of steps and expressed doubt that such efforts could be completed in time 
16 See 47 CFR § 54.9(a).
17 Initial Extension Request at 18-19 (referencing Supply Chain Further Notice).  Specifically, Pine Cellular 
explained that if it built out its existing Huawei network to the Choctaw Nation communities as originally planned, it 
would be using insecure equipment, and may ultimately need to rip out and replace the newly-installed network due 
to the Supply Chain restrictions.  Id. at 21.
18 See 47 CFR § 54.9; Initial Extension Request at 24.  See also Supply Chain Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 11452, para. 
72.  Although the rule does not prohibit USF recipients from using their own funds to purchase or obtain equipment 
or services from covered companies, the Commission stated that it “believe[s] it unlikely that many USF recipients 
will be able to show the detailed records necessary to demonstrate that no USF funds were used” and expressed 
skepticism “that any USF recipient seeking to use USF funds on an ‘eligible’ portion of such a project would will be 
able to establish with the necessary certainty.”  Id.
19 Initial Extension Request at 23-24.  
20 Id. at 22-23.  Pine Cellular argued that if it had constructed a parallel network without using Huawei equipment to 
meet its TLBC construction deadline, it would not be eligible for cost reimbursement for the additional expense, 
estimated at $8 million, through the Supply Chain proceeding. Id. at 17-19, 21.  Pine Cellular’s net winning bid for 
the license at issue was approximately $4.88 million; and it was granted a Tribal lands bidding credit of 
approximately $2 million.  See File No. 0007750369.

to meet the deadline.25  On December 14, 2021, the Bureau granted Pine Cellular’s request, extending the 
construction deadline by one year to January 9, 2023.26
7. Since Pine Cellular’s Second Extension Request was granted, the Reimbursement 
Program application window closed.27  Pine Cellular’s applications for reimbursement have been 
approved by the Commission and it has received allocations from the Reimbursement Program.28  
8.Third Extension Request.  On October 25, 2022, Pine Cellular filed the instant Third 
Extension Request, which seeks waiver of Section 1.2110(f)(3)(vii) to allow additional time to meet the 
TLBC construction requirement.29  Pine Cellular argues that it needs additional time to construct because 
it faces “unique and unusual circumstances” and “ongoing equipment supply chain issues, related in part 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, have undermined Pine Cellular’s efforts to move forward with the 
deployment of facilities utilizing 600 MHz spectrum to serve the Choctaw Nation communities.”30  Pine 
Cellular requests that the Bureau further extend its deadline to meet its TLBC construction obligation “so 
that this deadline is the same as the one-year deadline for the Company’s completion of the permanent 
removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment pursuant to the 
Reimbursement Program.”31  
9. On November 30, 2022, the Bureau issued a Public Notice seeking comment on Pine 
Cellular’s Third Extension Request.32  No commenters filed in response to Pine Cellular’s request, and we 
have received no opposition from the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.
III. DISCUSSION
10. Pursuant to section 1.925 of the Commission’s rules, a waiver may be granted if the 
petitioner establishes that: (1) the underlying purpose of the rule would not be served or would be 
frustrated by application to the instant case, and that grant of the waiver would be in the public interest; or 
(2) in view of unique or unusual factual circumstances of the instant case, application of the rule would be 
inequitable, unduly burdensome or contrary to the public interest, or the applicant has no reasonable 
25 Id. at 10.  Specifically, Pine Cellular stated that, in order to meet the extended January 9, 2022 deadline, it would 
have to (1) complete construction of a parallel mobile wireless broadband network in the areas served by its current 
network; (2) switch its operations over to this parallel network; (3) remove its old network facilities, including 
facilities serving Choctaw Nation communities, which had relied on Huawei equipment for core functions; and (4) 
complete the extension of the newly-built parallel network to serve the Choctaw Nation communities, in compliance 
with the TLBC construction requirements.  Id. at 6-7.

on December 15, 2022, and the Commission issued an initial draw down disbursement to Pine Cellular on January 
15, 2023, then Pine Cellular’s TLBC construction deadline would be January 15, 2024, the same date as its 
Reimbursement Program deadline for the removal of covered communications equipment.  In addition, Pine Cellular 
argues, if the Commission extends the one-year Reimbursement Program deadline by six months for all recipients, 
pursuant to section 1.50004(h)(1) of its rules, this extension should also apply to Pine Cellular’s TLBC construction 
deadline.  Id.

alternative.33  Section 1.946 of the Commission’s rules governs extensions of construction periods for 
stations in the wireless radio services.34  The rule provides that relief may be granted for good cause if 
such relief is requested before the expiration of the construction period.35  As described in more detail 
below, we find that the unique circumstances described by Pine Cellular warrant a third limited waiver 
and further extension of Pine Cellular’s TLBC construction requirement deadline. 
11. As an initial matter, we note that the Commission has recognized that “members of 
federally-recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Villages . . .and other residents of Tribal 
lands have lacked meaningful access to wired and wireless communications services.”36  In recognition of 
this challenge, the Commission established the TLBC program to provide incentives for wireless service 
providers to deploy advanced wireless services to benefit the residents and communities on Tribal lands.37  
The Commission recognized that various circumstances, including economic factors, could affect the 
ability of recipients to meet the TLBC requirements,38 and “strongly encourage[d] parties to seek waivers 
of specific rules or file other requests for regulatory relief in those instances where greater flexibility than 
the rules allow would facilitate the provision of service to tribal lands.”39
12.  For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Pine Cellular has no reasonable 
alternative to meet its TLBC construction requirement, and that application of the deadline set by section 
1.2110(f)(3)(vii) of the Commission’s rules would be contrary to the public interest.40  As Pine Cellular 
noted in its prior extension requests, it already had wireless mobile infrastructure in place in this service 
area and did not anticipate that the Supply Chain rules would substantially alter its plans to build out its 
existing network when it received its 600 MHz license with a Tribal land bidding credit.41  Pine Cellular 
explains that its TLBC construction progress has since been further affected by equipment supply chain 
issues, related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic.42  Specifically, Pine Cellular explains that its efforts to 
meet the January 9, 2023 TLBC construction deadline have been negatively impacted by the global 
33 47 CFR § 1.925(b)(3).
34 47 CFR § 1.946(e).  
35 Id.  Pine Cellular’s TLBC construction deadline is January 9, 2023, and it filed its request prior to that deadline, 
on October 25, 2022.

semiconductor shortage, and that it lacks any reasonable alternatives for meeting the deadline.43  Pine 
Cellular explains that it “cannot add covered communications equipment to its existing network in order 
to enable deployment of 600 MHz broadband service in the Choctaw Nation communities, because the 
Commission’s rules prohibit such use of covered communications equipment.”44  Further, Pine Cellular 
states that, even if it could obtain all of the needed compliant equipment in a timely manner—which it 
asserts it cannot—it could not add this compliant equipment to its network because it would not be 
compatible with Huawei equipment still in use in its existing network.45  Pine Cellular notes that its only 
alternative is to first remove and replace all Huawei equipment in its existing network, and then to 
construct a new network with compliant equipment.46  Pine Cellular asserts that, unfortunately, this 
alternative has not been (and is not currently) viable by the January 9, 2023 deadline.47
13. We agree that Pine Cellular’s current choices for network deployment to the Choctaw 
Nation communities are not reasonable alternatives.  Moreover, we find that strict application of the 
TLBC construction requirement, which would result in either Pine Cellular’s repayment of its TLBC or 
automatic termination of its license, is not warranted.48  Neither the repayment of the TLBC nor the 
automatic termination of the license would facilitate the provision of wireless broadband service to the 
Choctaw Nation communities, and thus would not serve the public interest or the underlying purpose of 
the TLBC rule.  We also find that grant of a waiver to Pine Cellular under these circumstances is 
consistent with prior TLBC construction deadline waiver requests granted by the Bureau.49    
14. With respect to the length of the extension, we determine that extending Pine Cellular’s 
construction deadline one year, until January 9, 2024, is sufficient and decline to extend its TLBC 
buildout date “so that this deadline is the same as the one-year deadline for the Company’s completion of 
the permanent removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment pursuant to the 
43 Id. at 11. Although Pine Cellular began placing orders in January 2022 for needed replacements for the Huawei 
equipment throughout its existing network, it states that it had received only 80 percent of the orders as of October 
2022 because of “the unprecedented demand for semiconductors and the vendors’ inability to obtain semiconductors 
in sufficient quantities to construct equipment and fill pending orders in a timely fashion.”  Id. at 10-11.
44 Id. at 11, citing 47 CFR § 54.9 (prohibiting use of Universal Service funds for covered equipment).  We further 
note that since the filing of Pine Cellular’s Third Extension Request, the Commission has adopted its proposal to 
prohibit authorization of equipment that has been identified on the Commission’s Covered List.  See generally 
Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain through the Equipment 
Authorization Program, Protecting Against National Security Threats to the Communications Supply Chain through 
the Competitive Bidding Program; ET Docket No. 21-232, EA Docket No. 21-233; Report and Order, Order, and

48 47 CFR § 1.2110(f)(3)(viii).  Any licensee that fails to provide the post-construction certification demonstrating it 
met its TLBC buildout obligation in a timely manner must repay the bidding credit amount in its entirety, plus 
interest, within 30 days of the deadline, or face automatic termination of its license.  With imposition of these 
penalties, a licensee’s commitment to serve the Tribal land is no longer applicable.    
49 For example, the Bureau has granted extensions due to lack of available equipment that meets regulatory 
requirements.  See LL License Holdings, LLC Waiver Request for Extension of Time for Wireless Services, Call 
Signs WQKH490 and WQKH491 (File Numbers 0005204801 and 0005204802), Order, 30 FCC Rcd 1937 (2015)

Reimbursement Program,” including any related extensions.50  At the time Pine Cellular filed this Third 
Extension Request, it expected that by the end of 2022 it would have received sufficient compliant 
equipment from its suppliers to enable the removal, replacement, and disposal of covered 
communications equipment, and committed to giving first priority to its existing network facilities in the 
Choctaw Nation communities.51  We believe that, with this one-year extension, Pine Cellular will have 
sufficient time to determine how it can navigate equipment supply chain issues and serve the Choctaw 
Nation communities while meeting Commission requirements.
IV. CONCLUSION
15. Pine Cellular has demonstrated that an extension of its TLBC construction deadline is 
warranted under the standards contained in sections 1.925 and 1.946 of the Commission’s rules.  We 
grant Pine Cellular a waiver of section 1.2110(f)(3)(vii) of the Commission’s rules and extend the TLBC 
construction deadline until January 9, 2024, for Call Sign WRAM805.  Notification that such construction 
has been completed must be filed with the Commission within fifteen (15) days of the deadline, by 
January 24, 2024.

SEARCHLIGHT II HMT, L.P.  
MB Docket No. 23-2
Comment Date:  February 3, 2023
Reply Date:  February 21, 2023
Searchlight II HMT, L.P. (Searchlight II HMT or Petitioner) has filed a petition for declaratory 
ruling1 (Petition) requesting the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) to find that it would 
be in the public interest to permit foreign ownership of Searchlight II HMT’s controlling U.S. parent, 
Hemisphere Media Group, Inc. (HMTV), to exceed the 25% benchmarks in section 310(b)(4) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended.2  HMTV has an existing declaratory ruling in which the 
Commission previously authorized foreign ownership up to 100 percent of HMTV’s equity and voting 
interests in the aggregate.3    
The Commission’s approval is being sought in connection with two applications pending at the 
Commission to (1) transfer control of broadcast television licenses held by Televicentro of Puerto Rico, 
LLC (Televicentro), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of HMTV, from Gato Investments LP (Gato) to 
Searchlight II HMT4 (HMTV Transaction); and (2) transfer control of WLII/WSUR Licensee Partnership,

approval for foreign entities and/or individuals, in the aggregate, to hold up to 100 percent of HMTV’s equity and 
voting interests.  See 47 CFR § 1.5000 et seq.  The Hemisphere Declaratory Ruling provided specific approval for 
certain foreign investors, but the interests held by those investors were acquired by Gato Investments LP (Gato) in

transaction, 100 percent of the outstanding common stock of HMTV became indirectly owned by Gato, and HMTV 
became no longer publicly traded.  See LMS File No. 0000191021.  See also Amended & Restated Petition at 2-3

G.P. (WLII/WSUR), a subsidiary of Univision of Puerto Rico, Inc., and an indirect, wholly owned 
subsidiary of TelevisaUnivision, Inc., from Univision Puerto Rico Station Operating Company to 
Intermedia Español, Inc. (TU Transaction).5  
The Petition lays out the proposed post-closing ownership of HMTV, Televicentro, and 
WLII/WSUR in light of the HMTV and TU Transactions.6  Upon the closing of the wind-up of Gato, 
Searchlight II HMT will hold 100 percent of the membership interests in HWK Parent, LLC, and will 
indirectly hold 100 percent of the equity and voting interests in HMTV.7  At the same time as the closing 
of the HMTV Transaction, Searchlight Capital II EXU AIV, L.P., Searchlight Capital II PV, L.P., and SC 
II HMT, L.P., which each hold warrants in Searchlight II HMT, will exercise their respective warrants 
and will be issued new limited partnership interests in Searchlight II HMT.8  As a result, each of these 
investment fund vehicles will hold indirect equity interests in HMTV.9  Conversion of the warrants to 
equity interests will cause attribution of foreign ownership interests indirectly in HMTV through certain 
Searchlight investment fund entities organized in the Cayman Islands and that are ultimately controlled by 
foreign individuals, as well as through the foreign limited partners in each of the investment fund 
entities.10  In addition, the proposed TU Transaction will ultimately result in the transfer of control of the 
WLII/WSUR broadcast radio stations to HMTV.11  HMTV is the parent of Intermedia Español, Inc. 
(Intermedia Español), and HMTV and Intermedia Español will be directly ultimately controlled by 
Searchlight II HMT.12
Pursuant to section 1.5001(h) of the Commission’s rules, the Petitioner requests approval of up to 
an aggregate 100% indirect foreign ownership of the controlling U.S. parent, HMTV.13  In the Petition, 
Searchlight II HMT requests specific approval14 for certain foreign individuals and entities that will hold, 
indirectly, more than five percent of the equity and/or voting interests of HMTV and advance approval15 
for each individual and entity to increase their interests in HMTV to certain percentages at some future 
time.16  Specifically, the Petition makes the following requests for advance approval: Erol Uzumeri 
(Canada) to hold up to 49.9% equity and be deemed to hold 100% voting; Oliver Haarmann (Germany) to 
hold up to 49.9% equity and be deemed to hold 100% voting; Searchlight Capital II PV, L.P. (Cayman 
Islands) to hold up to 100% equity and be deemed to hold 100% voting; SC II HMT Holdings, Ltd. 
(Cayman Islands) to hold up to 100% equity and be deemed to hold 100% voting; Searchlight Capital II 
UNR AIV, L.P. (Cayman Islands) to hold up to 100% equity and be deemed to hold 100% voting; and 
Searchlight Capital Partners II GP, L.P. (Cayman Islands) to hold up to 100% equity and be deemed to 
hold 100% voting.17  Searchlight II HMT contends that granting this Petition is in the public interest

because it will, inter alia, further the Commission’s goals of encouraging greater access to foreign 
investment in broadcast stations and increasing regulatory transparency.18  
According to the Petition, Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. (“Searchlight”) provides 
management and other advisory services to Searchlight-affiliated investment funds in return for a fee.19  
Nonetheless, the Petition asserts that Searchlight has no economic ownership interest in the investment 
funds and has no decision-making authority with respect to their operations.20  The Petition asserts that all 
management and decision-making authority with respect to the funds rests with the general partners of the 
funds.21  Petitioner states that Searchlight is controlled by its general partner, Searchlight Capital Partners, 
LLC (Delaware), which is controlled by its three members, Messrs. Eric Zinterhofer (United States), Eric 
Uzumeri (Canada), and Oliver Haarmann (Germany).22  These same three individuals are also the only 
limited partners of Searchlight.23  All other funds that Searchlight manages are also controlled by Messrs.  
Zinterhofer, Uzumeri, and Haarmann.24  Petitioner states that aside from Mr. Zinterhofer, neither 
Searchlight, nor any of its employees have any active or direct role at HMTV or its subsidiaries.25  
The Petition has been found, on initial review, to be acceptable for filing.  The Commission may 
require Searchlight II HMT, L.P. to submit additional documents or statements of fact that in the 
Commission’s judgment may be necessary.  The Commission also reserves the right to return the Petition 
if, on further examination, it is determined to be defective and not in conformance with its rules and 
policies.  In addition, pursuant to Commission practice, the Petition will be referred to relevant Executive 
Branch agencies for their views on any national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade policy 
concerns related to the foreign ownership of Searchlight II HMT, L.P.26

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Adopted:  January 4, 2023 Released:  January 4, 2023
By the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION   
1. In this Order, we approve the plan submitted by Core Communications, Inc. (Core) to 
refund certain interstate access service charges Core assessed certain interexchange carriers (IXCs) 
pursuant to its unlawful tariff.1  This Order follows the Core Tariff Investigation Order in which the 
Commission concluded the investigation into Core’s tariff revisions, directed Core to revise its tariff, and 
directed the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) to determine any refunds that may be required once 
the newly revised tariff is effective.2  
II. BACKGROUND
2. Core is a competitive local exchange carrier (LEC) that serves as an intermediate carrier, 
primarily for toll free calls.  As a competitive LEC, Core is permitted, but not required, to file interstate 
switched access service tariffs with the Commission.3  On April 22, 2021, Core filed Transmittal No. 17 
(Revised Tariff), revising various provisions of its interstate access services Tariff F.C.C. No. 3, including 
provisions regarding billing disputes, late-payment fees, cancellation, and toll free (8YY) database query 
charges.4  Core’s revisions included changes to section 2.10.5 of the tariff, which increased the monthly 
late-payment fee from a maximum of 1.5% to the lesser of 3.0% or “the highest rate permitted by 
applicable law,” if the “unpaid amount is not part of a good faith dispute as described in [the] tariff.”5  On 
May 6, 2021, the Bureau adopted the Suspension Order, finding that substantial questions existed

regarding the lawfulness of Core’s Revised Tariff that required further investigation.6  The Bureau 
suspended the Revised Tariff for one day, thereby allowing it to go into effect without being deemed 
lawful, adopted an accounting order, and initiated an investigation into the lawfulness of the Revised 
Tariff.7 
3. On June 23, 2021, the Bureau released a Designation Order directing Core to provide 
information that the Commission needed to determine whether the late-payment fee provision was just 
and reasonable.8  Core then filed its Direct Case responding to the questions the Bureau asked in the 
Designation Order.9  AT&T and Verizon filed oppositions to the Direct Case, arguing that Core’s late-
payment fee was unjust and unreasonable.10  
4. In the Core Tariff Investigation Order, the Commission found, in relevant part, that Core 
failed to demonstrate that the late-payment fee provision in section 2.10.5 of the Revised Tariff was just 
and reasonable.11  The Commission found that the 3% late-payment fee was unreasonable, and that the 
reference to the “highest rate permitted by applicable law” was unlawful because the provision was 
impermissibly ambiguous, in violation of section 61.2 of the Commission’s rules.12  Accordingly, the 
Commission found that the revisions to the tariff, including those to section 2.10.5, were not just and 
reasonable, as required by section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act).13  
The Commission, therefore, instructed Core to delete the revisions it made in Transmittal No. 17.14  The 
Commission also instructed the Bureau to: (1) ensure that Core made the appropriate changes to its tariff 
to reflect the Commission’s findings; and (2) determine the amount of any refunds Core owed to its 
customers.15

queries when the underlying call is not completed.  Id. at 10008-11, paras. 31-37, 39-41.

unlawful.  Verizon Opposition to Direct Case at 7-23.

5. On October 15, 2021, Core filed tariff Transmittal No. 21, deleting the unlawful revisions 
it made to its tariff in Transmittal No. 17.  Transmittal No. 21 became effective on October 30, 2021.16  
The period during which the unlawful tariff was in effect (the Refund Period), therefore, is May 7, 2021 
(the day after the Suspension Order was released) through October 29, 2021 (the day before Transmittal 
No. 21 became effective).
6. Core filed a proposed Refund Plan on June 29, 2022, which calculated the reductions 
Core would make to its late-payment fees during the Refund Period.17  We sought comment on Core’s 
proposed Refund Plan.18  Verizon filed an Opposition asking the Commission to reject the Refund Plan 
and instead direct Core to submit a revised plan under which Core would collect no late-payment fees 
during the Refund Period.19  Otherwise, it claimed, Core “would suffer no consequences for its unlawful 
tariff filing.”20  AT&T filed a comment urging the Commission “not to disturb any of the findings it made 
in its Core Orders, or otherwise address the specifics of any payment disputes between Core and 
AT&T.”21 
III. DISCUSSION
7. We find that the refunds proposed in Core’s Refund Plan are reasonable and properly 
reflect the findings in the Core Tariff Investigation Order.22  We reject arguments made by Verizon in its 
Opposition, which seek relief inconsistent with section 204 of the Act, and address issues AT&T raised in 
its comment concerning the potential effect of this Order on pending disputes.23
8. In its Refund Plan and attached spreadsheet, Core calculates the specific amounts it will 
refund to individual customers as a result of having assessed an unlawfully high 3% monthly late-
payment fee during the Refund Period24 instead of the 1.5% monthly late-payment fee ceiling that had 
previously been in effect.25  Core’s spreadsheet provides the relevant invoice amounts necessary to 
support its calculations.26

22Federal Communications Commission DA 23-5
9. Core incorrectly argues that it is not making any refunds, and is only making downward 
adjustments to the outstanding balances of some of its customers.27  Core’s attempt to distinguish between 
the term “refunds” and its planned “downward adjustments” is a distinction without substance and does 
not affect its refund obligations pursuant to the Core Tariff Investigation Order.  Moreover, in a section 
204 tariff investigation proceeding, “refunds” are not restricted to cash payments but may also include a 
variety of forms of non-cash payment.  For example, in the South Dakota Network (SDN) tariff 
investigation, the Bureau directed SDN to make a refund in the form of a credit on the invoices of 
affected customers.28  In this tariff investigation, the refunds Core is required to make take the form of 
reductions to customers’ late-payment fees, another form of non-cash payment.  Put simply, those 
reductions are the refunds contemplated by the Commission in the Core Tariff Investigation Order. 
10. Verizon asks the Commission to reject the Refund Plan, direct Core to submit a new plan, 
and bar Core from assessing any late-payment fees during the Refund Period.29  Verizon argues that 
Core’s Revised Tariff “imposed substantial costs on other carriers and on the Commission,” and that Core 
“should face consequences that deter the filing of such unlawful tariffs in the first place.”30  Verizon 
essentially is asking the Commission to award damages similar to punitive damages by requiring Core to 
forgo the 1.5% monthly late-payment fee that its tariff would otherwise allow during the Refund Period.  
Verizon does not contend that the 1.5% late-payment fee is unlawful, only that it and other customers 
should be granted other relief to dissuade Core from future unlawful tariff filings.  But section 204 of the 
Act grants the Commission the authority to order refunds, not punitive damages.31  Further, Verizon 
makes no argument that Core’s Refund Plan would not adequately compensate carriers for excessive 
charges they incurred as a result of Transmittal No. 17.  We therefore deny Verizon’s request to direct 
Core to submit a revised refund plan that imposes no late-payment fees during the Refund Period.32
11. In its comment, AT&T raises concerns about the potential impact of this Order on prior 
Commission decisions concerning Core’s tariffs, and pending litigation between Core and AT&T.33  We 
affirm that this Order neither modifies the Commission’s previous findings in this or any other related 
proceedings nor addresses pending litigation. 
12. We find that the refunds proposed by Core are sufficient to implement the Commission’s 
decision in the Core Tariff Investigation Order.  Core explains that it “made no other changes to its

proposal to lower the monthly late-payment fee from the 3% Core assessed during the Refund Period to 
1.5% for the Refund Period, and direct Core to make those changes for the affected customers.  This

the Core Tariff Investigation Order,36 that the Refund Plan filed by Core Communications, Inc., on June 
29, 2022, is APPROVED.

its assessed late-payment fee for the Refund Period in accordance with the Refund Plan within 45 days of 
the release date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order.

In November 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) launched the ACP Outreach 
Grant Program to raise awareness about the nation’s largest ever broadband affordability effort, the 
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP).  The ACP Outreach Grant Program provides grant funding for 
four complementary programs:  the National Competitive Outreach Program (NCOP);1 the Tribal 
Competitive Outreach Program (TCOP);2 the YHYI Outreach Grants;3 and the NPP Outreach Grants.4  
These programs provide new federal funding for the FCC to grant eligible governmental and non-
governmental entities funding and resources needed to increase awareness of and participation in the ACP 
among those households most in need of affordable connectivity.
Through the ACP Outreach Grant Program, the FCC seeks to enlist and empower trusted 
community messengers to develop innovative outreach strategies to reach historically underserved and 
unserved communities.  This includes providing those partners with the funding and resources needed to 
increase participation among eligible, low-income households.  
1 The NCOP provides up to $60 million in available funding (information about NCOP is in the ACP Grant Program 
NOFO).  See Affordable Connectivity Outreach Grant Program, Notice of Funding Opportunity, FCC-ACOGP-23-

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU GRANTS 900 MHZ BROADBAND 
SEGMENT APPLICATIONS 
WT Docket No. 17-200
By this Public Notice, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) announces the grant of 
five 900 MHz broadband segment license applications (see Appendix).  On May 13, 2020, the 
Commission realigned the 900 MHz band to make available six megahertz of low-band spectrum for the 
development of critical wireless broadband technologies and services, while reserving the remaining four 
megahertz of spectrum for continued narrowband operations.1  In accordance with the 900 MHz Report 
and Order,2 the Bureau announced that the opening date for acceptance of 900 MHz broadband segment 
applications began on May 27, 2021.3 
The Bureau finds the 900 MHz broadband segment applications listed in the Appendix to be 
complete and in conformance with the Commission’s rules.  No petitions to deny these applications were 
filed, and the applications sufficiently demonstrate conformance with the eligibility conditions (Eligibility 
Certification) and requirements for transitioning the 900 MHz band in the particular county requested 
(Transition Plan).4  Furthermore, the Commission has received full anti-windfall payments for the 
licenses listed in the Appendix, as required by section 27.1503(c)(2).  Therefore, the Bureau finds that 
granting the applications for the 900 MHz broadband segment licenses listed in the Appendix serves the 
public interest, convenience, and necessity. 
Accordingly, by this Public Notice, we announce the grant of the licenses listed in the Appendix.  
We grant these licenses pursuant to section 309(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 309(a), and 
sections 0.131 and 0.331 of the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR §§ 0.131, 0.331.  New 900 MHz broadband 
licensees may begin operation in the applicable counties, subject to protecting covered incumbents.5

FOR USE IN NORTH AMERICAN NUMBERING COUNCIL FILINGS
WC DOCKET NO. 23-1
CC DOCKET NO. 92-237
By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau establishes WC Docket No. 23-1 for use 
in filing materials related to the North American Numbering Council (NANC).1  The NANC is a federal 
advisory committee created to advise the Commission on numbering issues and to make 
recommendations that foster efficient and impartial number administration.  It is organized under, and 
operates in accordance with, the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).2  Opening a 
new, dedicated docket will enable the public to more easily access materials related to the NANC going 
forward.  
Ex Parte Exemptions and Filings.  Under the FACA, the Commission is responsible for oversight 
of the NANC, including its working groups and any subcommittees.3  As a result, FCC Commissioners 
and staff may participate in or attend meetings or other activities held by both the NANC and its working 
groups and subcommittees.  For this reason, pursuant to section 1.1200(a) of the Commission’s rules, 47 
CFR § 1.1200(a), presentations to the NANC, including to its working groups and subcommittees, and at 
any roundtable discussions sponsored by the NANC, as well as presentations between NANC members 
(including members of any working groups and subcommittees) and FCC Commissioners or staff 
incidental to and in connection with such NANC meetings or roundtable discussions, will be treated as 
exempt presentations for ex parte purposes.4  This exemption covers presentations from NANC members 
to FCC Commissioners and staff in other settings only to the extent that the NANC members are 
presenting the views of the NANC or its working groups, as opposed to an individual member’s own 
views or that of a member’s organization. 
We recognize that some issues may be addressed by the NANC that are the subject of pending 
FCC proceedings.  For these proceedings, the Commission will not rely on any information submitted to

ORDER
Adopted:  January 4, 2023 Released:  January 4, 2023
By the Chief, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. By this Order, the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal 
Communications Commission grants a request filed by seventeen groups and individuals for an extension 
of the time in which to file comments in response to the Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further 
Notice) in this docket.  As determined by the date of publication in the Federal Register, comments and 
reply comments were originally due on January 17, 2023 and February 14, 2023, respectively.  Pursuant 
to this Order, we extend the comment date 30 days to February 16, 2023.  Reply comments are now due 
March 16, 2023.
II. BACKGROUND
2. On December 16, 2022, the Federal Register published a summary1 of Empowering 
Broadband Consumers Through Transparency, CG Docket No. 22-2, Further Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking.2  The Further Notice sets deadlines for filing comments and reply comments at 30 and 60 
days after the date of publication of the summary of the Further Notice in the Federal Register.  
Consistent with the Further Notice, the Federal Register Notice states that comments are due no later than 
January 17, 2023, and reply comments are due no later than February 14, 2023.3  
3. On December 21, 2022, Free Press and sixteen other groups and individuals submitted a 
request for a 60-day extension of time to the comment and reply comment deadlines.4  These parties 
assert that an extension to the comment deadline is reasonable and warranted in order to adequately 
develop the record in this proceeding.5  They observe that the comment period overlaps with the winter

holiday season in addition to other important broadband-related deadlines, including the deadline for 
challenges to the broadband availability maps and a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) deadline for 
comments on its “junk fees” proceeding.6  The parties assert that an extension would “enable people to 
participate in all relevant proceedings, which would benefit the Commission, comity with the FTC, and 
the public interest.”7  Finally, they argue that an “additional 60 days would provide reasonable 
accommodation for the many public interest advocates, civil rights organizations, researchers, data 
experts, and consumers whose voices should be heard in this proceeding.”8
III. DISCUSSION
4. As set forth in section 1.46 of the Commission’s rules, it is the policy of the Commission 
that extensions of time shall not be routinely granted.9  However, extensions may be considered “to the 
extent that good cause for an extension is demonstrated.”10  The criteria for granting requests for 
extensions of time “are that the extension be in the public interest, cause no harm to any party in the 
proceeding, and cause no significant delay.”11  The Commission has previously found that an extension of 
time is warranted when it is “necessary to ensure that the Commission receives full and informed 
responses and that affected parties have a meaningful opportunity to develop a complete record for the 
Commission’s consideration.”12
5. We find good cause to grant an extension.  Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, and the 
Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. are all within the comment period, shortening the normal time for 
drafting and filing comments.  We agree with Free Press and the others that an extension will more fully 
develop the record in this proceeding while affording commenters more ability to participate in other 
important, consumer-oriented proceedings.  
6. We disagree with the petitioners that a full two months is necessary in this case.  We find 
that an extension of 30 days better balances the needs the petitioners describe and timely action on the 
Label.  We therefore find that a 30-day extension is appropriate.13  Accordingly, comments are due on or 
before February 16, 2023, and reply comments are due on or before March 16, 2023.  
7. To request materials in accessible formats (such as Braille, large print, electronic files, or

1. By this Order, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications 
Commission (Commission) grants a 45-day extension of time for filing reply comments on the Sixth 
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the above-captioned proceeding. With the 45-day extension,

2. On September 30, 2022, the Commission released the Fourth Report and Order and Sixth 
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.1  In that item, the Commission adopted reforms of interstate 
inmate calling services, including improvements to access to communications services for incarcerated 
people with communication disabilities.2  In the Sixth Further Notice portion of the item, the Commission 
sought comment on a number of outstanding issues.3  The filing deadlines were set at December 15, 2022 
for initial comments and January 17, 2023 for reply comments.4

Movants assert that an additional grant of time would allow for “a thorough and well-developed record, 
including from stakeholder reply comments” and “would enable more fulsome public participation in the 
reply comment round.”6   They argue, inter alia, that their analysis of the record, “totaling over 500 pages, 
including at least 100 pages of expert reports, statistical studies, and other exhibits,” will cause “resource 
challenges,” and request the additional time to help “secure the resources necessary to actively

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU GRANTS AUCTION 108 LICENSES
Auction No. 108
By this Public Notice, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) announces the grant of 
four long-form applications and issuance of 12 licenses for Auction 108.  On August 29, 2022, the 
Federal Communications Commission (Commission) completed the auction of new flexible-use 
geographic overlay licenses in the (2.5 GHz) band, and the Office of Economics and Analytics (OEA) and 
the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) announced the results of that auction on September 1, 
2022.1  This auction raised a total of  $419,133,261 in net bids and $427,789,670 in gross bids, with 63 
bidders winning a total of 7,872 licenses.2  Long-form applications for licenses won in Auction 108 were 
due on September 16, 2022.3  WTB accepted these four Auction 108 applications for filing on December 
8, 2022.4  
Upon further review and examination, WTB finds the applications for the licenses listed in 
Attachment A to be complete and in conformance with the Commission’s rules. We find that granting the 
applications for the licenses listed in Attachment A serves the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  
Furthermore, the Commission has received full payment for the licenses listed in Attachment A, as 
required by section 1.2109(a) of its rules.5  Accordingly, by this Public Notice, we announce the grant of 
the licenses listed in Attachment A.  We grant these licenses pursuant to section 309(a) of the 
Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 309(a), and sections 0.131 and 0.331 of the Commission’s rules, 47 
C.F.R. §§ 0.131, 0.331. 
We remind licensees that they should review all Commission orders and public notices 
establishing rules and policies for the 2.5 GHz Band.6  Each licensee is solely responsible for complying 
1 Auction of Flexible-Use Licenses in the 2.5 GHz Band Closes, Public Notice, DA 22-910 (OEA & WTB Sept. 1, 
2022).
2 “Gross bids” refers to the total of winning bid amounts at the close of bidding and does not reflect any small 
business or rural service provider bidding credits claimed by eligible winning bidders.  “Net bids” refers to the total 
of winning bid amounts as adjusted for any small business or rural service provider bidding credits claimed by 
winning bidders. 
3 On October 26, 2022, WTB released the first accepted for filing public notice for Auction 108 which found 52 
applications acceptable for filing. Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Announces that Applications for Auction 
108 Licenses Are Accepted for Filing, Public Notice, DA 22-1125 (WTB Oct. 26, 2022).  Subsequently, on 
December 1, 2022, WTB granted 51 of those 52 applications. Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Grants Auction 
108 Licenses, Public Notice, DA 22-1243 (WTB Dec. 1, 2022).

with all FCC rules and regulations associated with these licenses.  Notably, we remind Auction 108 
licensees that they must protect existing incumbent licenses, including Rural Tribal Priority Window 
(RTPW) licenses.7  We further remind licensees that pending RTPW applications may affect the licenses 
issued in Auction 108.  Licenses granted through applications received during the RTPW will have 
incumbent status vis-à-vis licenses awarded in Auction 108.8  In other words, any winning bidder 
awarded a license in Auction 108 may not operate within the license area of a successful RTPW 
applicant, even if that RTPW application remains pending at the time of issuance of the Auction 108 
overlay license.

)

ORDER
Adopted:  January 5, 2023 Released:  January 5, 2023
By the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. By this Order, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) grants a Motion filed by the 
Cloud Communications Alliance, NCTA – The Internet & Television Association, NTCA – The Rural 
Broadband Association, USTelecom – The Broadband Association, the Voice on the Net Coalition, and 
WTA – Advocates for Rural Broadband seeking an extension of 12 days for filing reply comments in the 
above-captioned proceeding.1 
II. BACKGROUND
2. On October 27, 2022, the Commission adopted a Notice of Inquiry to seek comment on 
caller ID authentication for non-Internet Protocol (IP) networks.2  To further the Commission’s efforts to 
protect Americans from illegally spoofed robocalls, the Notice sought focused comment on potential 
authentication solutions for non-IP networks and the nexus between non-IP caller ID authentication and 
the IP transition generally.3  Interested parties were required to file their initial comments by December 
12, 2022 and their reply comments by January 11, 2023.
3. Pursuant to section 1.46 of the Commission’s rules,4 Cloud Communications Alliance, 
NCTA, NTCA, USTelecom, the Voice on the Net Coalition, and WTA filed a joint motion for an 
extension of time on December 22, 2022 to submit their reply comments.  As justifications for the 
extension, the parties point to the complexity of issues raised in the Notice and the initial round of 
comments and the challenges caused by key staff taking leave during the holiday season.5  Many of the 
companies potentially affected by this proceeding, the parties argue, are smaller companies with limited 
resources that are unable to provide significant feedback over this holiday period.6     
III. DISCUSSION
4. As set forth in section 1.46 of the Commission’s rules, it is the policy of the Commission 
that extensions of time shall not be routinely granted.7  However, the Commission may consider an 
1 Motion of Cloud Communications Alliance, NCTA, NTCA, USTelecom, the Voice on the Net Coalition, and 
WTA for Extension of Time, WC Docket No. 17-97 (filed Dec. 22, 2022) (Dec. 22 Extension Request).

extension “to the extent that good cause for an extension is demonstrated.”8  The criteria for granting 
requests for extensions of time “are that the extension be in the public interest, cause no harm to any party 
in the proceeding, and cause no significant delay.”9  The Commission has previously found that an 
extension of time is warranted when it is “necessary to ensure that the Commission receives full and 
informed responses and that affected parties have a meaningful opportunity to develop a complete record 
for the Commission’s consideration.”10
5. Here, the Bureau finds good cause to grant the extension request.  The holiday season, 
including two Federal holidays,11 fell within the reply comment period, and the Bureau is cognizant of the 
challenges this poses to commenters, specifically smaller companies with more limited resources over the 
holiday season.  The Bureau finds that an extension of 12 days to file reply comments is warranted to 
allow interested parties the time to meaningfully review and reply to the information in the record, and 
that this brief extension will not harm any party in the proceeding nor cause a significant delay in the 
Commission’s ability to consider the issues raised in this proceeding in a timely manner.12  Thus, the 
Bureau extends the deadline for the filing of reply comments until January 23, 2023.   
6. To request materials in accessible formats for people with disabilities (braille, large print, 
electronic files, audio format), send an e-mail to fcc504@fcc.gov or call the Consumer and Governmental

Commission’s rules, 47 CFR §§ 0.204, 0.291, 1.46, that the Motion for Extension of the Reply Comment 
deadline is hereby GRANTED.
9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the date for filing reply comments in response to the

ORDER
Adopted:  January 5, 2023 Released:  January 5, 2023
By the Chief, Wireline Competition Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Order, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) addresses the petition of VPNet, 
Inc. (VPNet),1 seeking a limited waiver of the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program (EBB Program) 
reimbursement rules.  VPNet requests a waiver of the requirement that it certify reimbursement by the 
15th of the month2 for the October 2021 service month.3  
2. Based on our established waiver standard, we grant VPNet a waiver to submit certified 
claims for the October 2021 service month by February 15, 2023.  In addition, we grant, on our own 
motion, a limited waiver to participating providers that uploaded, but did not certify, their reimbursement 
claims for discounted service provided in the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service 
months by their respective claims deadlines.  This limited waiver will allow the limited number of 
affected providers to certify any such previously uploaded claims for the December 2021, January 2022, 
and February 2022 service months by February 15, 2023.  We conclude that these limited waivers are 
consistent with the Program’s statutory requirements and will serve the public interest.
II. DISCUSSION
3. As a general matter, “an agency must adhere to its own rules and regulations.”4  Although 
strict application of a rule may be justified “to preserve incentives for compliance and to realize the 
benefits of easy administration that the rule was designed to achieve,”5 the Commission’s rules may be 
waived for “good cause shown.”6  The Commission may exercise its discretion to waive a rule where 
special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule, and such deviation will serve the public 
interest.7  The Commission may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective 
implementation of overall policy on an individual basis.8  The Bureau, under delegated authority, may act 
on requests for waiver of rules.9

4. To receive reimbursement under the EBB Program rules, providers must submit certified 
reimbursement claims through the Lifeline Claims System by the 15th of each month, or the following 
business day in the event the 15th is a holiday or falls on a weekend.10  If the participating provider fails 
to submit a certified reimbursement claim by the deadline for that service month, the reimbursement 
claim will not be processed.11  The Bureau has previously released waivers on June 8, 2021,12 August 10, 
2021,13 September 3, 2021,14 and February 11, 2022,15 that allowed providers additional time to file 
certified reimbursement claims.
5. Based on the record before us, we grant the limited waiver request of VPNet.  We will 
permit VPNet an extension of time until February 15, 2023 to submit certified reimbursement claims for 
its October 2021 service month claims.  VPNet requests a limited waiver of the certification requirement 
for the October 2021 service month.16  VPNet says that it began processing its claims for the October 
2021 service month on November 11, 2021, but was unable to successfully upload the Claims Input 
Template.17  VPNet argues that good cause exists to grant a waiver of the reimbursement rules because 
VPNet took steps that should have been sufficient to timely complete and certify its reimbursement claim 
for the October 2021 service month.18  VPNet further argues that grant of a waiver will avoid a 
miscarriage of justice and further provide assurance to participating providers that continued participation 
in the EBB Program and its successor program the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) will not 
expose them to undue risk of economic harm.19  VPNet further states that granting a waiver will not 
undermine the EBB Program or ACP.20
6. Based on the record before us, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for a limited 
waiver of the requirement of section 54.1608(g) of the Commission’s rules to permit VPNet to submit 
certified reimbursement claims for the October 2021 service month by February 15, 2023.  We find that it

is in the public interest to allow VPNet the opportunity to certify its reimbursement claims for October 
2021, given that VPNet in good faith attempted to timely submit its reimbursement claims by the 
deadline, and the financial hardship VPNet may face if not allowed to seek reimbursement.  We also find 
that granting this waiver to VPNet should neither undermine any program integrity controls, nor invite 
waste, fraud, and abuse because VPNet will still only be able to claim reimbursement for subscribers that 
completed the eligibility verification process and did receive discounted service.  This waiver is limited to 
VPNet’s claims for the October 2021 service month.
7. Additionally, the Bureau, on its own motion, grants a limited waiver to allow those EBB 
Program providers that uploaded but did not certify their claims for the December 2021, January 2022, 
and February 2022 service months by their respective claims deadline additional time to complete the 
certification process.  Those providers will have until February 15, 2023 to submit certified 
reimbursement claims for discounts provided in the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 
service months.
8. Based on the record before us, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for a limited 
waiver of the requirement of section 54.1608(g) of the Commission’s rules to permit providers that 
uploaded their reimbursement claims for the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service 
months by January 18, 2022, February 15, 2022, and March 15, 2022 respectively, but failed to certify 
those claims by those respective deadlines, until February 15, 2023 to certify such claims.  We find that it 
is in the public interest to allow these providers the opportunity to certify their submitted reimbursement 
claims, given the substantial hardship they may face if not allowed to seek reimbursement.  We also find 
that granting this waiver should not undermine any program integrity controls, nor invite waste, fraud, 
and abuse.  This waiver is limited to participating providers that successfully uploaded their 
reimbursement claims for the December 2021, January 2022, and February 2022 service months for 
discounted service provided to qualified subscribers, but did not certify them, thus ensuring that the 
providers’ claimed subscribers were in fact enrolled in National Lifeline Accountability Database 
(NLAD) as of the snapshot date on the 1st of the month and that the provider had made a good faith effort 
at identifying and claiming reimbursement for those subscribers by the deadline.

REPORT AND ORDER
(Proceeding Terminated)
Adopted:  January 9, 2023 Released:  January 9, 2023
By the Chief, Video Division, Media Bureau:
1. The Video Division, Media Bureau (Bureau), has before it a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking1 issued in response to a Petition for Rulemaking filed by Gray Television Licensee, LLC 
(Gray or Petitioner),2 the licensee of television station WMC-TV (WMC-TV or Station), channel 5, 
Memphis, Tennessee.  The Petitioner has requested the substitution of UHF channel 30 for VHF channel 5 
in the Table of TV Allotments.3  The Petitioner filed comments in support of the petition, as required by 
the Commission’s rules (rules),4 reaffirming its commitment to apply for channel 30.  No other comments 
were received.
2. We believe the public interest would be served by substituting channel 30 for channel 5 
at Memphis, Tennessee.  The Petitioner states that the proposed channel substitution resolves significant 
over-the-air reception problems in WMC-TV’s service area due to its operation on a low VHF channel,  
reception problems which the Commission has recognized exist on VHF channels.5   An analysis using 
the Commission’s TVStudy software tool indicates that WMC-TV’s move from channel 5 to channel 30 is 
predicted to create an area where 4,072 persons may lose service.  The loss area, however, is largely 
overlapped by the noise limited contours of other NBC affiliated stations and most viewers will continue 
1 Amendment of Section 73.622(j), Table of  Allotments, Television Stations (Memphis, Tennessee), MB Docket No. 
22-146, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, DA 21-694 (rel. Apr. 5, 2022) (NPRM).  
2 Petition of Gray Television Licensee, LLC for Rulemaking, as amended (filed Nov. 27, 2020, LMS File No. 
0000127522) (Petition).  Gray requested confidential treatment for certain information contained in the November 
2020 Petition pursuant to sections 0.459 and 0.457 of the Commission’s rules (rules), 47 CFR §§ 0.457, 0.459, and 
the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552.  Gray amended the November 2020 Petition on February 10, 2022 
(Amended Petition and Supplemental Engineering Statement) to provide a supplemental engineering statement with 
a further analysis of the population served by the proposed channel 30 facility, and to report that it had acquired 
three low power television (LPTV) stations which it intended to modify to better serve the predicted loss areas.  
Because the Amended Petition and Supplemental Engineering Statement did not include the confidential 
information or the legal and economic arguments on which it was based, we dismissed the November 2020 Petition.

3 47 CFR § 73.622(j).
4 47 CFR §§ 1.415, 1.419; see also Buffalo, Iola, Normangee, and Madisonville, Texas, MB Docket No. 07-729,

5 Amended Petition at 3; NPRM at para. 2.

to receive service from five or more stations,6 In addition, the Petitioner acquired three LPTV stations 
(WANF-LD, Dyersburg, Tennessee (channel 32); WDDY-LD, Jackson, Tennessee (channel 15); and 
W20DW-D, Clarksdale, Mississippi (channel 20)) and constructed modified facilities to deliver NBC 
programming to viewers in the loss area.7  As a result, only 64 persons would either (1) no longer receive 
NBC network programming or (2) no longer receive service from five or more full power television 
services.8  In practice, Gray expects that few, if any, persons who are currently able to receive WMC-
TV’s over-the-air signal on channel 5 would no longer be able to receive WMC-TV’s over-the-air signal 
as a result of the Station’s transition to channel 30.9  
3. As proposed, channel 30 can be substituted for channel 5 at Memphis, Tennessee, in 
compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a) of the rules,10 at 
coordinates 35° 10'  09" N and 89° 53'  10" W.  Although the Petitioner’s proposal would result in a loss 
for a limited number of viewers, we find that the overall benefits of the proposed channel change 
outweighs any possible harm to the public interest when taking into account the ability of all but a de 
minimis number of viewers to access NBC programming from another source.  In addition, we find that 
this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules with 
the following specifications:11
City and State                           Channel    Power (kW)    Antenna  HAAT (m)    Service Pop. 
Memphis, Tennessee                  30             515                307.7                         1,556,336 
4. We also conclude that good cause exists to make this channel change effective 
immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act.12  An expedited effective date is necessary in this case to ensure that WMC-TV can 
operate with improved service to its viewers as quickly as possible.
5. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in sections 4(i), 5(c)(1), 303(g), (r) and 
307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 154(i), 155(c)(1), 303(g), (r), and 
307(b), and sections 0.61, 0.204(b) and 0.283 of the rules, 47 CFR §§ 0.61, 0.204(b), and 0.283, IT IS 
ORDERED, That effective immediately upon the date of publication in the Federal Register, the Table of 
6 These stations are WTVA, Tupelo, Mississippi (channel 11), licensed to Mississippi TV License Company LLC; 
KAIT, Jonesboro, Arkansas (channel 27), licensed to the Petitioner; and  WNBJ-LD, Jackson, Tennessee (channel 
16), licensed to CTT Licensee LLC.  Supplemental Engineering Exhibit, Figures 2, 3.
7 Gray amended its Petition on December 29, 2022, to confirm that the three LPTV stations have been built and 
licensed, and that these stations are now operating and serving the predicted loss areas. See LMS File Nos. 
0000205962, 0000203485, and 0000199038.  While these LPTV stations, as well as WNBJ-LD referenced above, 
supra note 7, are secondary and can be displaced, we believe that it is unlikely that these stations would be displaced 
and, if they were, the licensees would be able to find displacement channels for them.  See NPRM at n.5.
8 Amended Petition at 5; Supplemental Engineering Statement at 4-5, Figure 3.  The Commission has previously 
stated that it is “generally most concerned where there is a loss of an area’s only network or NCE TV service, or 
where the loss results in an area becoming less that well-served, i.e., served by fewer than five full-power stations.”

Alpha Media Holdings Inc. (New Alpha) has filed a petition for declaratory ruling1 requesting 
that the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) find, pursuant to section 310(b)(4) of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, (Act)2 and section 1.5000(a)(1) of the Commission’s rules,3 
that it would serve the public interest to allow New Alpha to accept foreign investment in excess of the 
25% benchmarks set forth in section 310(b)(4).4  Specifically, New Alpha seeks a Commission ruling to 
(1) permit up to 100% aggregate foreign investment (voting and equity) in the company, and (2)

5 Under section 1.5001(i)(1) of the Commission’s rules, petitioners for a declaratory ruling are required to identify 
and seek specific approval for any foreign individual, entity, or group that holds or would hold, directly and/or 
indirectly, more than 5% of equity and/or voting interests, or a controlling interest, in the petitioner’s controlling

56Federal Communications Commission DA 23-18
Alpha.6  New Alpha filed the Petition on behalf of itself and each of its indirect wholly owned 
subsidiaries that hold Commission broadcast licenses.7  
New Alpha seeks this declaratory ruling due to changes in its ownership structure that are an 
outgrowth of the recent bankruptcy reorganization of New Alpha and its subsidiaries, which hold 
broadcast licenses.8  Following its emergence from bankruptcy, and pursuant to Commission approval 
and waiver of section 1.5000(a)(1) of the Commission’s rules,9 New Alpha is currently owned by former 
creditors that held second lien note claims in Alpha Media Holdings LLC Debtor-in-Possession (Old 
Alpha) prior to New Alpha’s emergence from bankruptcy (the Owners).10  In accordance with New 
Alpha’s Joint Plan of Reorganization (Plan),11 the Owners exchanged their second lien note claims in Old 
Alpha for pro rata equity shares representing (1) New Alpha Common Stock (Equity Interests), which 
confer voting rights, and (2) New Alpha Warrants (Warrants).12  
Specifically, the Owners holding direct attributable interests in New Alpha after its emergence 
from bankruptcy are:  (1) MetLife Private Equity Holdings, LLC (MPEH), a Delaware limited liability 
company (41.7% equity and voting); (2) Florida Growth Fund LLC (FGH), a Delaware limited liability 
company (27.4% equity and voting); (3) Hamilton Lane Strategic Opportunities 2016 Fund LP (HLSOF), 
a Delaware limited partnership (21.6% equity and voting); and (4) ICG North America Holdings Ltd. 
(ICGNA), a Cayman Islands corporation (5.7% equity and voting).13  
New Alpha’s Plan contemplates that a “substantial majority of the New Alpha Warrants will be 
exercised for New Equity Interests that would cause (a) New Alpha’s aggregate foreign ownership to 
exceed 25 percent and (b) certain foreign Owners to hold equity and/or voting interests in New Alpha that

in New Alpha.  Id.  New Alpha states that its post-declaratory ruling day-to-day operations will remain under the 
control of U.S. citizens.  Id. at 2.  
7 See id. at 2 & Attach. A, Petitioners, Subsidiaries, Licenses, and Applications.  New Alpha, a Delaware 
corporation, through two wholly owned subsidiaries (Alpha Media Licensee LLC and Alpha 3E Licensee LLC), 
owns and operates 236 full power radio broadcast stations and translator stations licensed by the Commission.  The

See Alpha Approval Order at 17, para. 48 (requiring filing of a petition for declaratory ruling within 30 days of 
emergence from bankruptcy).

ruling to exceed the aggregate foreign ownership benchmark set forth in section 310(b)(4) of the Act “at the same 
time that it files its application” for transfer of control and requiring filing of a petition for declaratory ruling within 
30 days of emergence from bankruptcy).
10 See Petition at 3.
11 Pursuant to the Plan, New Alpha acquired 100% of the equity interests in Old Alpha.  Id. at 4.

are convertible instruments that by their terms may be exercised only if consistent with the Communications Act.  
Id. at 3, n.6.
13 Id. at 4.  The foreign equity and voting percentages include interests held directly and indirectly in New Alpha.  
The remaining 3.6% voting and equity interests in New Alpha are held by non-attributable interest holders.  See

would require specific approval.”14  New Alpha estimates that if the Commission were to grant the 
Petition and the Warrants are fully exercised, it would have foreign ownership of more than 70% on both 
an equity and voting basis.15  The Petition seeks authorization for up to 100% aggregate foreign voting 
and equity investment in order to permit flexibility for New Alpha to take on additional foreign ownership 
in the future.  
After the exercise of the Warrants, five entities will hold the following direct attributable interests 
in New Alpha:  (1) MPEH (23.6% equity; 25% voting);16 FGH (7.9% equity; 8.3% voting);17 (3) HLSOF 
(7.9% equity; 8.3% voting);18 (4) ICGNA (39.1% equity; 41.4% voting);19 and (5) BigSur Capital 
Partners Three Corp. (BigSur), a British Virgin Islands corporation (6.3% equity; 6.7% voting).20  New 
Alpha seeks specific approval for BigSur, ICGNA, and four foreign entities affiliated with ICGNA, to 
each hold more than 5% of New Alpha’s equity and/or voting interests.21  New Alpha also seeks advance 
14 Id. at 5.  New Alpha expects that the holders of more than 91% of its Warrants will exercise their Warrants 
following grant of the Petition.  Id. at 7.  New Alpha states that one group of its Warrant holders has indicated that it 
does not intend to exercise its Warrants, but “even considering the group’s Warrants on a fully diluted basis, the 
group would not hold an interest in New Alpha that requires specific approval.”  Id.  New Alpha also states that two 
additional New Alpha Warrant holders, which are indirectly commonly controlled by a Cayman Islands limited 
partnership, hold Warrants that, if fully exercised, would cause the partnership to hold an indirect voting and equity 
interest of more than 5%.  New Alpha explains, however, that the holders “have indicated that they intend to transfer 
a sufficient number of Warrants or take other action to ensure that the Cayman Islands partnership’s interest does 
not exceed 5 percent of Alpha’s voting or equity and, thus, does not require specific approval.”  Id.  According to 
New Alpha, these two Warrant holders are U.S. insurance companies whose combined interest represents an 
approximately 5.75% interest in New Alpha calculated on a fully-diluted basis.  Second Supplement at 3.  Aside 
from the interests held indirectly through the insurance companies and a de minimis interest held through an 
insulated limited partner of ICG North American Private Debt Fund LP (see First Supplement at 5, n.10) the 
Cayman Island partnerships hold no other direct or indirect interests in New Alpha.  Second Supplement at 3-4, 
n.11.  Further, in addition to committing to reduce their combined interest to less than 5%, New Alpha asserts that 
specific approval is not required for these entities as they hold less than a 10% interest in New Alpha (a privately 
held company); are prohibited from becoming actively involved in New Alpha; and hold rights equal to or less than 
minority shareholder protections permitted by the Commission’s rules.  Second Supplement at 3-4.  In addition, 
New Alpha indicates that it has entered into an agreement with the insurance companies reaffirming the limitations 
on the involvement of those entities.  Second Supplement at 4-6, Attach. B.  
15 Petition at 8.  New Alpha clarifies that “this estimate is based upon direct inquiry of the entities that will hold 
direct and/or indirect ownership interests in New Alpha and calculations performed by New Alpha’s advisors.”  Id.,

exercise of the Warrants), and Attach. D (listing percentage estimates of New Alpha’s aggregate direct and indirect 
foreign equity and voting interests following the exercise of the Warrants and a general description of the methods 
used to determine the percentages).  The remaining equity and voting interests in New Alpha are held by other non-
attributable shareholders.  See Attach. C-5. 
21 In the Petition, New Alpha indicated that MPEH had a Japanese affiliate, MetLife Insurance, K.K. (MIK).  
According to New Alpha, the interests held by MIK were to be transferred to MPEH prior to the exercise of 
Warrants, and accordingly, MIK would not require specific approval.  See Petition at 8, 13.  By its Second 
Supplement, New Alpha has confirmed that MIK has assigned all of the warrants and stock MIK received at Alpha’s

approval for BigSur, ICGNA, and the four ICGNA-affiliated foreign entities to hold up to 49.99% of New 
Alpha’s equity and/or voting interests.22  The ownership of these entities, and projected equity and voting 
interests in New Alpha, is discussed below.23  New Alpha states that neither MPEH, FGH, HLSOF, nor 
any of the entities or individuals in each of those entity’s ownership structure, require specific approval.24  
New Alpha argues that grant of the Petition will serve the public interest by “enabling it to better 
compete in the media marketplace, incentivizing foreign investment in broadcasting, and promoting U.S. 
trade policy by encouraging reciprocal investment opportunities for U.S. companies in foreign markets, 
while avoiding any risks to national security, law enforcement, or foreign or trade policy.”25  New Alpha 
emphasizes that the proposed foreign owners of interests requiring specific approval are organized under 
the laws of the United Kingdom, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and Jersey, “all of which 
are allies of the United States and investors in its economy, and with which the U.S. is engaged in robust 
reciprocal trade.”26 
ICGNA and Affiliated Foreign Entities
As proposed in the Petition, ICGNA, a Cayman Islands corporation, will hold an approximate 
39.1% direct equity interest and 41.4% direct voting interest in New Alpha.  The following four foreign 
entities affiliated with ICGNA will hold the following indirect equity and voting interests in New Alpha, 
and therefore, also require specific approval:  (1) Intermediate Capital Group PLC (ICG PLC), a United 
Kingdom private limited company (10.6% equity; 46.7% voting); (2) ICG FMC Limited (ICG FMC), a 
United Kingdom private limited company (0% equity; 43.2% voting); (3) ICG Global Investment Jersey 
Limited (ICG Jersey), a Jersey registered private company (7.3% equity; 7.7% voting); and (4) ICG 
Global Investment UK Limited (ICG UK), a United Kingdom private limited company (7.3% equity; 
7.7% voting).27  New Alpha also seeks authorization for ICGNA, ICG PLC, ICG FMC, ICG Jersey, and 
ICG UK to hold up to 49.99% of New Alpha’s equity and/or voting interests.28  The ownership structure 
of ICGNA and its affiliated entities is detailed below.  
emergence from bankruptcy to MEH.  Second Supplement at 1- 2, Attach. A (providing copies of the executed 
assignment of warrants and stock).  New Alpha indicates that MIK assigned its interests to MPEH ten days after the 
filing of the Petition and no longer holds any interest in Alpha, and therefore does not require specific approval.  Id. 
at 2.  
22 See id. at 16 & nn.40-41.
23 See also Petition, Attach. E (listing each entity or individual for which specific approval is requested).
24 Id. at 13-15; Supplement at 2-3 & Attach. A.  New Alpha explains that although “MPEH, FGH, and HLSOF 
themselves have some foreign ownership and thus contribute modest amounts of foreign ownership to New Alpha’s 
aggregate foreign ownership . . . no entity affiliated with these U.S. [Owners] requires specific approval.”  Petition 
at 8.  None of the foreign owners will hold more than a 5 percent indirect voting or equity interest in New Alpha 
and, accordingly, none will require specific approval under the Commission’s rules.  Petition at 13-15.
25 Id. at 2, 17-25.  New Alpha states that the “important public interest benefits with enabling greater foreign 
investment in communications companies take on added significance in the context of a company, such as New 
Alpha, that has recently restructured its debt load through the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process.”  Id. at 19.  According 
to New Alpha, “permitting the conversion of debt to equity (or warrants to equity) following the grant of any 
necessary declaratory ruling will serve the important goal of incentivizing . . . foreign debt investments in companies 
subject to the Communication Act’s foreign ownership limitations, allowing such companies to emerge in a stronger 
economic position.”  Id.
26 Id. at 23.
27 See id. at 16 & Attach. E.  New Alpha states that the projected equity and voting percentages are approximate and 
may differ from what is reported at the closing of the transaction, but that it will supplement the Petition to the 
extent it determines that any material changes are likely to occur.  Id.
28 See id. at 16 & nn.40-41.
59Federal Communications Commission DA 23-18
ICG Jersey holds a 18.57% equity and voting interest in ICGNA.  Following the exercise of 
ICGNA’s Warrants, ICG Jersey will hold an approximate 7.3% equity and 7.7% voting interest in New 
Alpha, indirectly through ICGNA.  Therefore ICG Jersey, a foreign entity, requires specific approval.29  
ICG Jersey is wholly owned by ICG UK, also a foreign entity, and therefore ICG UK, through its 
ownership of ICG Jersey, similarly holds an indirect 7.3% equity and 7.7% voting interest in New Alpha 
that requires specific approval under the Commission’s rules.30
ICG North American Private Debt Fund LP (ICG North American LP), a Delaware limited 
partnership, holds a 79.64% equity and voting interest in ICGNA.31  ICG North American LP’s sole 
general partner is ICG North American Private Debt GP LP (ICG North American GP), a Delaware 
limited partnership, with a 100% voting interest in ICG North American LP.32  ICG North American LP’s 
limited partners, which New Alpha states are insulated in accordance with the Commission’s rules, hold 
100% of its equity.33  ICG North American GP’s sole general partner is ICG North America Associates 
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company,34 which is wholly owned by its sole member, ICG FMC, a 
foreign entity.35  
ICG Fund Advisors, LLC (ICG Advisors), a Delaware limited liability company, is the 
investment manager of ICGNA’s investment in New Alpha and controls, as investment advisor, ICGNA’s 
41.4% voting interest in New Alpha.36  In addition, ICG Advisors also acts as the investment manager for, 
and controls a portion of the interests held by, two additional warrant holders that New Alpha states will 
not hold an attributable interest in New Alpha or require specific approval.  This amounts to ICG 
Advisors holding an additional voting interest of approximately 1.8% in New Alpha.37  ICG Advisors is 
wholly owned by Intermediate Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which, in turn, is wholly 
owned by ICG FMC, a foreign entity.38  Accordingly, ICG FMC, through its indirect ownership of 
ICGNA and ICG Advisors, holds an indirect 43.2% voting interest in New Alpha that requires specific 
approval under the Commission’s rules.39

Alpha states that each of the foreign insulated limited partners of ICG North American LP holds less than a 32.11% 
equity interest in ICG North American LP, and accordingly, no such limited partner requires specific approval.  
Supplement at 3-5.
34 ICG North American GP’s limited partners, which New Alpha states are insulated in accordance with the 
Commission’s rules, hold all of its equity.  Petition at 11; Supplement, Attach. D (certification of Brian Spenner on 
behalf of ICG North American GP).  Because ICGNA’s equity flows through ICG North American LP to its limited 
partners, neither ICG North American GP nor its limited partners have an indirect equity interest in ICGNA.

Finally, ICG PLC, a foreign entity, ultimately controls ICGNA as the sole shareholder of ICG 
FMC and ICG UK, with a direct interest of 100% (equity and voting) in those two entities.40  In addition, 
ICG PLC will also directly hold approximately a 3.3% equity interest and a 3.5% voting interest in New 
Alpha.41  Accordingly, when combined with the indirect 7.3% equity and 43.2% voting interests that it 
holds in New Alpha through its ownership of ICG FMC and ICG UK, ICG PLC will hold an approximate 
10.6% total equity interest and 46.7% total voting interest in New Alpha.42   
BigSur
As proposed in the Petition, BigSur, a British Virgin Islands corporation, will hold an 
approximate 6.3% direct equity interest and a 6.7% direct voting interest in New Alpha.43  New Alpha 
seeks authorization for BigSur to hold up to 49.99% of New Alpha’s equity and/or voting interests.44  
BigSur Partners, LLC (BigSur LLC), a Delaware limited liability company, holds a 100% voting interest 
and 0% equity interest in BigSur.45  BigSur LLC has three U.S. members: (1) Gorriti Investments, LLC, a 
Florida limited liability company; (2) BigSur Advisors Corp., a Florida corporation;46 and (3) PCP 
Advisors Corp., a Florida corporation.47 
BigSur’s equity interests are owned by 15 funds registered in the Bahamas, Netherlands, British 
Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, and New Zealand.  According to New Alpha, each fund holds an equity 
interest of between 3.0% and 12.2% in BigSur, is insulated in accordance with the Commission’s 
broadcast attribution rules, and will hold less than a 1% indirect equity (and deemed voting) interest in 
New Alpha.48   
Pursuant to Commission practice, the Petition will be referred to relevant Executive Branch 
agencies for their views on any national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade policy

THIRD QUARTER 2022 INFLATION ADJUSTMENT FIGURES FOR CABLE OPERATORS 
USING FCC RATE REGULATION FORM 1240 NOW AVAILABLE
This Public Notice is applicable to rate-regulated cable operators that use FCC Forms to justify 
their cable rates.1  Cable operators adjusting the non-external cost portion of their rates for inflation 
should follow the instructions provided with the applicable FCC Form.  All inflation adjustment figures 
are based on changes in the Gross National Product Price Index (GNP-PI) published by the United States 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).  The chain-type price indexes were 
obtained from the BEA Table 1.7.4 (Price Indexes for Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Product, 
and Net National Product) Line 4 (Gross National Product) on December 23, 2022.2
Operators filing FCC Form 1240 may make an adjustment based on quarterly figures.  The third 
quarter 2022 inflation factor for operators using FCC Form 1240 is 4.37%.  The adjustment factor of 
4.37% is a measure of the annualized change in prices occurring over the period from July 1, 2022 to 
September 30, 2022.  The inflation adjustment factor is calculated by dividing the GNP-PI for the third 
quarter of 2022 (128.248) by the GNP-PI for the second quarter of 2022 (126.885).  The result of this 
calculation is converted from a quarterly change measurement factor to an annual change measurement 
factor by raising it to the fourth power.  We then convert the calculation to an inflation adjustment factor 
by subtracting one.   
Operators calculating the Inflation Factor for a True-Up Period that includes some portion of the 
third quarter of 2022 should enter the inflation factor on the appropriate lines of Worksheet 1 of FCC 
Form 1240 as “0.0437.”  Operators using this factor for calculating the Projected Period Inflation 
Segment of FCC Form 1240 should enter this number on Line C3 (January 1996 version), or Line C5 
(July 1996 version) as “1.0437”.
Each quarter the Commission releases a quarterly inflation factor for use with FCC Form 1240.  
The following table lists these factors beginning in 2017.3
1 Pursuant to 47 CFR § 76.922(d)(2) and § 76.922(e)(2) of the Commission’s rules, cable operators may adjust the 
non-external cost portion of their rates for inflation.

The Commission releases a new quarterly inflation factor for operators using FCC Form 1240 four 
times each year.  The inflation factor for a given quarter is usually released between three and four months 
after the end of the quarter, depending on the schedule of the Department of Commerce.  The release of a

of  TV Allotments.  The Petitioner filed comments in support of the petition, as required by the 
Commission’s rules (rules),3 reaffirming its commitment to apply for channel 36.  No other comments 
were received.  
2. We believe the public interest would be served by substituting channel 36 for channel 10 
at Norwell, Massachusetts.  According to the Petitioner, it has received many complaints from viewers 
unable to receive a reliable signal on channel 10, a VHF channel.4  The Petitioner further states that the 
Commission has recognized the deleterious effects manmade noise has on the reception of digital VHF 
signals, and that the propagation characteristics of these channels allow undesired signals and noise to be 
receivable at relatively farther distances compared to UHF channels, and nearby electrical devices can 
cause interference.5  
3. An analysis conducted using the Commission’s TVStudy software tool indicates that 
WWDP’s proposed channel substitution is predicted to create areas where viewers may lose service.  
However, we believe any possible harm resulting from the loss of service to some viewers is outweighed 
by the overall benefit of improving reception to the Station’s viewers, including the Station’s community

of license.  Moreover, the viewers in the loss area are already well-served by five or more stations and no 
viewers will lose service from one of the four major networks or any noncommercial educational station.6   
4. As proposed, channel 36 can be substituted for channel 10 at Norwell, Massachusetts, in 
compliance with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a) of the rules,7 at 
coordinates 42° 18' 37.0" N and 71° 14' 12.0" W.  In addition, we find that this channel change meets the 
technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of the rules with the following specifications:8
City and State                           Channel    Power (kW)    Antenna  HAAT (m)    Service Pop.

5. We also conclude that good cause exists to make this channel change effective 
immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act.9  An expedited effective date is necessary in this case to ensure that WWDP can operate 
with improved service to its viewers as quickly as possible.

Comment Date:  [30 days after date of publication in the Federal Register]
Reply Comment Date:  [45 days after date of publication in the Federal Register] 
By the Chief, Video Division, Media Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Video Division, Media Bureau has before it a petition for rulemaking filed by Blue 
Ridge Public Television, Inc. (Petitioner or Blue Ridge PBS), the licensee of noncommercial educational 
television PBS member station WBRA-TV (WBRA-TV or Station), channel *3, Roanoke, Virginia.1  The 
Petitioner requests the substitution of channel *13 in place of channel *3 at Roanoke, Virginia in the 
Table of TV Allotments.2 
II. BACKGROUND
2. In support of its channel substitution request, the Petitioner states that apart from WBRA-
TV, only one of the seven other full-power television stations in the Roanoke-Lynchburg DMA operates 
on a VHF channel, and it operates on high-VHF channel 7.  The Petitioner asserts that allowing the 
Station to move to a high-VHF channel would improve viewers’ access to the Station’s PBS and other 
public television programming by improving reception and resolving low-VHF reception issues.3  
According to Petitioner, it has received many complaints from viewers unable to receive a reliable signal 
on channel *3, with some viewers noting that WBRA-TV is the only Roanoke station they cannot receive 
reliably over the air.4  Petitioner further states that the Commission has recognized that VHF channels 
have certain propagation characteristics which may cause reception issues for some viewers, as well as 
the existence of environmental noise blockages affecting VHF signal strength and reception, which may

(Petition).  We note that Petitioner amended its Petition on January 9, 2023 (Amended Engineering Statement) to 
include further analysis of the population that may lose predicted service as a result of the proposed channel 
substitution.  Amended Engineering Statement at 1.  Noncommercial educational television stations are identified in 
the Table of TV Allotments by an asterisk to indicate they are reserved for noncommercial educational use.  47 CFR 
§ 73.622(a).   
2 47 CFR § 73.622(j).
3 Petition at 2-3.  WBRA-TV is the only full-power noncommercial educational television station serving the 
Roanoke-Lynchburg DMA.  WBRA-TV currently broadcasts its PBS, public affairs programming, and emergency 
notifications through WBRA-TV’s participation in PBS’s Warning, Alert Response Network.  The Petitioner asserts 
that the proposed channel substitution will allow WBRA-TV to better serve the community by substantially 
improving viewer access to its educational and public affairs programming and emergency notifications.  Id. at 2.

72Federal Communications Commission DA 23-23
vary widely by service area.5  The Engineering Statement provided with the Petition confirms that the 
proposed channel *13 contour would provide full principal community coverage to Roanoke.  An analysis 
using the Commission’s TVStudy software tool, according to Petitioner, indicates that WBRA-TV’s move 
from channel *3 to channel *13 is predicted to create an area where 64,309 persons are predicted to lose 
service without considering the service from other PBS stations.6  However, when taking into account 
service from other PBS stations, only 94 persons are predicted to lose PBS service, a number which the 
Petitioner asserts the Commission has found to be de minimis.7   
III. DISCUSSION 
3. We believe that the Petitioner’s channel substitution proposal warrants consideration.  
Channel *13 can be substituted in place of channel *3 at Roanoke, Virginia, as proposed, in compliance 
with the principal community coverage requirements of section 73.625(a) of the Commission’s rules 
(rules),8 at coordinates 37° 11' 46.0" N and 80° 09' 16.0" W.  We believe any possible harm resulting 
from the loss of noncommercial educational service to some viewers is outweighed by the overall public 
interest benefit of improving reception to the Station’s viewers, including within the Station’s community 
of license.  Although the Petitioner’s proposal would result in a loss of PBS network programming to 
some viewers, when taking into account the service provided by noncommercial educational WUNC-TV 
and WUNL-TV to the WBRA-TV noise limited service contour area, fewer than 500 persons will lose 
access to PBS network programming, a number the Commission has deemed to be de minimis.9  We also 
find that this channel change meets the technical requirements set forth in sections 73.616 and 73.623 of 
the rules.10  Thus, we propose to substitute channel *13 in place of channel *3 for WBRA-TV with the 
following specifications:
City and State  Channel Power (kW) Antenna HAAT (m)
Roanoke, Virginia     *13      66 630.6
4. Accordingly, we seek comment on the proposed amendment of the Table of TV 
Allotments, section 73.622(j) of the rules,11 for the community listed below, to read as follows:
Channel No.
City and State Present Proposed
Roanoke, Virginia      *3, 27, 30, 34, 36  *13, 27, 30, 34, 36

5.Showings Required.  Comments are invited on the proposal discussed in this Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).  The Petitioner or any proponent that expresses interest in the allotment 
will be expected to answer whatever questions are presented in initial comments.  The petitioner of a

7 Engineering Statement at 5.  Petitioner’s analysis takes into account service being provided by PBS stations 
WUNC-TV, Chapel Hill, North Carolina (WUNC) and WUNL-TV, Winston-Salem, North Carolina (WUNL).    
8 47 CFR § 73.625(a). 
9 See WSET, Inc., 80 FCC 2d 233, 246 (1980) (finding that loss of service to approximately 550 persons is de 
minimis).  The vast majority of viewers that will no longer receive WBRA-TV are located in North Carolina and 
continue to be served by WUNL and WUNC, which are both North Carolina PBS affiliates.  In fact, many of those 
impacted viewers may already primarily rely upon WUNL and WUNC for their PBS network and public television 
programming.

WIRELINE COMPETITION BUREAU REMINDS SECURE AND TRUSTED 
COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM RECIPIENTS OF 
THEIR SPENDING REPORT FILING OBLIGATION
WC Docket No. 18-89
By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) reminds recipients in the 
Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Reimbursement Program (Reimbursement Program) of 
their obligation to file reimbursement spending reports with the Federal Communications Commission 
(Commission) by February 10, 2023.1  
As directed in the Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 (the Act), the 
Commission established the Reimbursement Program to reimburse providers of advanced 
communications services with ten million or fewer customers for reasonable costs incurred in the 
removal, replacement, and disposal of covered communications equipment or services from their 
networks that pose a national security risk.2  In accordance with the Act and Commission rules, each 
Reimbursement Program recipient must submit reports to the Commission describing “how 
reimbursement funds have been spent, including detailed accounting of the covered communications 
equipment or services permanently removed and disposed of, and the replacement equipment or services 
purchased, rented, leased or otherwise obtained, using reimbursement funds”3 within 10 days after the end 
of January and July, starting with the recipient’s initial draw down of reimbursement funds.4  This 
reporting obligation terminates once the recipient has filed a “final spending report showing the 
expenditure of all funds received as compared to the estimated costs” submitted.5  In the 2020 Supply 
Chain Order, the Commission noted that spending reports “help mitigate waste, fraud, and abuse by 
1 47 CFR § 1.50004(l).

intended.”6  
Recipients that have been notified of the approval of a reimbursement claim request7 must submit 
their first spending report on February 10, 2023.  Recipients must submit their spending reports through 
the Supply Chain Reimbursement Program Online Portal, https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/scrp by 
completing FCC Form 5640 Part L: Spending Reports.  
Public Posting and Requests for Confidentiality.  Pursuant to the Commission’s rules, the Bureau 
will make information submitted by recipients in their spending reports publicly available on the

The Commission “consider[s] detailed accounting information on the covered communications equipment 
or services permanently removed and disposed of, and the replacement equipment or services purchased, 
rented, leased, or otherwise obtained, using reimbursement funds presumptively confidential and will 
withhold such disaggregated information from routine public inspection.”9  Recipients may request 
confidential treatment of other information submitted in their spending reports pursuant to section 0.459 
of the Commission’s rules.10  Requests for confidential treatment must be submitted by filing a written 
request electronically in WC Docket No. 18-89 in the Commission’s Electronic Comments Filing System

ORDER
Adopted:  January 10, 2023 Released:  January 11, 2023
By the Acting Chief, Consumer Policy Division, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau:
1. In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Discount Long Distance, LLC (DLD) 
changed Complainant’s telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and 
verification from Complainant as required by the Commission’s rules.1  We find that DLD has responded 
fully to the Complainant’s complaint and has taken action to resolve the complaint.
2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), prohibits the 
practice of “slamming,” the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscriber’s selection 
of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2  The Commission’s implementing 
rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier 
change may occur.3  Specifically, a carrier must: (1) obtain the subscriber’s written or electronically 
signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules; (2) obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a 
toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically; or (3) utilize an 
appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4  The Commission has also adopted 
rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require 
carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without 
authorization.5 
3. We received Complainant’s complaint alleging that DLD had changed Complainant’s 
telecommunications service provider without Complainant’s authorization.  Pursuant to our rules, we

2 47 U.S.C. § 258(a).
3 See 47 CFR § 64.1120.
4 See id. § 64.1120(c).  Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or 
electronically signed authorizations.  Id. § 64.1130.
5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her 
bill.  If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability 
for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized 
change.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1160.  Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service 
provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber 
was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change.  Id.  Where the subscriber has paid 
charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commission’s rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of 
those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent 
of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1170.  
81Federal Communications Commission DA 23-26
notified DLD of the complaint.6  Based on the information provided by DLD, it appears that DLD has 
fully absolved Complainant of all charges assessed by DLD in a manner consistent with the 
Commission’s liability rules.7  We therefore find that the complaint referenced herein has been resolved.8
4. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 258, and sections 0.141, 0.361 and 1.719 of the Commission’s rules, 47 
CFR §§ 0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Discount Long Distance, LLC IS RESOLVED.
5. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order is effective upon release.

8 If Complainant is unsatisfied with the resolution of its complaint, the Complainant may file a formal complaint 
with the Commission pursuant to section 1.721 of the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR § 1.721.  Such filing will be 
deemed to relate back to the filing date of Complainant’s informal complaint so long as the formal complaint is filed

CONSUMER AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS BUREAU SEEKS COMMENT ON 
SORENSON COMMUNICATIONS, LLC’S PETITION FOR A LIMITED WAIVER OF THE 
PRIVACY SCREEN RULE FOR VIDEO RELAY SERVICE
CG Docket Nos. 03-123 and 10-51
Comments due:  February 13, 2023
Reply Comments due:  February 28, 2023
Pursuant to sections 1.1, 1.3, and 1.45 of the Commission’s Rules (47 CFR §§ 1.1, 1.3, and 1.45), 
the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB or Bureau) of the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC or Commission) seeks comment on a Petition for a Limited Waiver filed by Sorenson 
Communications, LLC (Sorenson).1  As a provider of Video Relay Service (VRS), Sorenson requests the 
Commission waive its visual privacy screen rule to allow VRS providers to pilot integration of VRS with 
video conferencing services.2  A “visual privacy screen” is defined as “a screen or any other feature that is 
designed to prevent one party or both parties on the video leg of a VRS call from viewing the other party 
during a call.”3  The privacy screen rule prohibits a VRS communications assistant (CA) from enabling a 
visual privacy screen or similar feature during a VRS call and requires the CA to disconnect a VRS call if 
the caller or called party enables a privacy screen or similar feature for more than five minutes or is 
otherwise unresponsive or unengaged for more than five minutes.4  This rule was adopted to prevent 
fraudulent practices where VRS minutes were logged while no one was engaged in a conversation.5
Sorenson contends that enforcement of the privacy screen rule would hinder the participation of 
VRS users in video conferencing calls because the participants, including deaf participants, in such calls 
may turn off their video connections for reasons unrelated to inactivity.6  Sorenson seeks a limited waiver 
of the rule that would allow VRS users to use interactive video conferencing services without video being 
activated, for longer than five minutes.7  Sorenson does not seek a waiver that would allow CAs to turn 
off their videos or use a privacy screen.8

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU AND OFFICE OF ENGINEERING 
AND TECHNOLOGY APPROVE RED TECHNOLOGIES TO BEGIN INITIAL 
COMMERCIAL DEPLOYMENT IN THE 3.5 GHZ BAND
GN Docket No. 15-319
I. INTRODUCTION
1. With this Public Notice, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) and the Office 
of Engineering and Technology (OET) (collectively, WTB/OET) of the Federal Communications 
Commission (Commission or FCC) certify that the Spectrum Access System (SAS) operated by RED 
Technologies SAS (RED) has satisfied the Commission’s SAS laboratory testing requirements1 and is 
approved to begin its initial commercial deployment (Initial Commercial Deployment or ICD) as 
described in its ICD proposal and consistent with the obligations and conditions detailed in this Public 
Notice and contained in the ICD Proposals Public Notice.2  WTB/OET, in consultation with the 
Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
(NTIA), have reviewed both RED’s SAS laboratory testing report and its ICD proposal.
II. BACKGROUND
2. In the 2015 Report and Order, the Commission directed WTB/OET—in consultation 
with the DoD and NTIA—to oversee the review, certification, and approval of SASs in the 3.5 GHz 
band.3  As required in the 2015 Report and Order, and as further described in the SAS/ESC Proposal 
Public Notice, all prospective SAS administrators must complete a two-stage review process prior to final 
1 Conditionally approved SAS Administrators are permitted to file their laboratory testing reports in GN Docket No. 
15-319.  Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology Establish Procedure and 
Deadline for Filing Spectrum Access System Initial Commercial Deployment Proposals, Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd 
7390, 7392, para. 5 (WTB/OET 2018) (ICD Proposals Public Notice). RED chose to file its laboratory testing report 
with the Commission and requested confidential treatment.  See Performance Certification Results for a 3.5 GHz 
Spectrum Access System Provided for Testing by RED Technologies SAS; Final SAS Certification Test Report 
Submission, GN Docket No. 15-319 (filed September 25, 2022) (RED SAS Test Report).     
2 RED’s ICD proposal was filed in GN Docket No. 15-319 consistent with the Commission’s instructions and RED 
requested confidential treatment for its ICD filings.  See ICD Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 7394-95, 
para. 11; RED Technologies SAS Proposal for Spectrum Access System Initial Commercial Deployment, GN 
Docket No. 15-319, (filed November 6, 2022) (RED ICD Proposal).

MHz Band, GN Docket No. 12-354, Report and Order and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC 
Rcd 3959, 4067, paras. 369-373 (2015) (2015 Report and Order and 2015 FNPRM, respectively); see also 47 CFR 
§§ 0.241(j), 0.331(f).

certification.4  In the first stage, a prospective SAS Administrator must submit a proposal describing how 
its system will comply with all Commission rules governing the construction, operation, and approval of 
SASs and perform all core functions described in the 2015 Report and Order.5  The second stage involves 
SAS testing both in a controlled lab environment and in a real-world setting.6  On May 7, 2021, 
WTB/OET conditionally approved RED’s SAS.7  
3. As part of the second stage testing process, RED elected to collaborate with the Institute 
for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS), NTIA’s research and development arm, in order to complete the 
laboratory testing requirement.8  ITS completed its laboratory testing and subsequently provided RED 
with a SAS laboratory test report, which RED submitted for the Commission’s review on September 25, 
2022.9  
4. In order to comply with the field testing requirement, in July 2018, WTB/OET sought 
proposals for short-term, limited geographic commercial deployment.10  Consistent with the requirements 
set forth in the ICD Proposals Public Notice, RED submitted its ICD proposal on November 6, 2022.11 
III. DISCUSSION
5. WTB/OET, in coordination with NTIA and DoD, are responsible for assessing and 
testing each conditionally approved SAS prior to final certification in both laboratory and real-world 
environments.12  ICD will satisfy the real-world element of the testing process and will allow WTB/OET 
to assess whether a SAS can operate under actual deployment conditions.13  
6. WTB/OET, in coordination with NTIA and DoD, reviewed RED’s laboratory test report 
and ICD proposal in detail.  Based on the information contained in those documents, WTB/OET find that 
RED’s laboratory test report satisfies the Commission’s requirement to assess and test each SAS in a

Deadline for Filing Spectrum Access System (SAS) Administrators(s) and Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) 
Operator(s) Applications, GN Docket No. 15-319, Public Notice, 30 FCC Rcd 14170, 14174-77 (WTB/OET 2015) 
(SAS/ESC Proposal Public Notice). 
5 See 2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4054-55, para. 320 (listing SAS core functions); see also SAS/ESC 
Proposal Public Notice, 30 FCC Rcd 14170; Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and 
Technology Conditionally Approve Three Spectrum Access System Administrators for the 3.5 GHz Band, Public 
Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 8255(WTB/OET 2021) (Second Wave SAS Conditional Approval Public Notice).  
6 See 2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4067, para. 372 (noting that the final compliance testing phase can 
include a public testing period, testing of protections for incumbent systems, and field trials).  On July 27, 2018, 
WTB/OET released a Public Notice that described the procedure and deadline for filing ICD proposals.  See ICD 
Proposals Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd 7390.  ICD is meant to fulfill the Commission’s requirement that applicants 
conduct a public testing period and field trials prior to final certification.  2015 Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 
4067, para. 372.
7 See Second Wave SAS Conditional Approval Public Notice. 
8 While lab testing of individual SASs is required before final certification, participation in either the process of 
verifying and validating the test harness or the subsequent lab testing of an individual SAS with ITS is optional and 
is not a prerequisite to submitting an ICD proposal or to obtaining final certification.  ICD Proposals Public Notice,

controlled lab environment and that the ICD proposal meets the requirements set forth in the ICD 
Proposals Public Notice.  WTB/OET therefore approve RED’s SAS for Initial Commercial Deployment 
subject to the following ongoing compliance obligations:
•RED must file a notification in GN Docket No. 15-319 stating: (1) the beginning date of 
its ICD period; (2) the specific geographic areas covered by ICD deployments; (3) 
whether its SAS is DPA-enabled;14 (4) whether its SAS will be operating with an 
approved Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) operator during ICD and, if so, which 
ESC they will be using;15 and (5) the expected end date of the ICD reporting period.  The 
notification must also include a primary point of contact for incumbent operators to use to 
report potential interference issues to its SAS16 and to obtain additional information about 
ICD operations, if needed. The ICD period may begin once this notification is filed.   
•ICD must continue for a minimum of 30 consecutive days, consistent with RED’s ICD 
proposal, and they must demonstrate compliance with the Commission’s rules and other 
requirements set forth in the ICD Proposals Public Notice.17  ICDs must involve a variety 
of testing scenarios featuring multiple Citizen Broadband Radio Service Devices 
(CBSDs)18 that result in the generation of data upon which the Commission can 
reasonably predict that its SAS can reliably operate in compliance with the Commission’s 
rules.19
•During ICD, RED must operate a SAS that is functionally consistent with its SAS tested 
in the laboratory environment.  SAS operators may implement software upgrades and 
patches to address any issues identified during ICD.
•RED must comply with all current and future Commission rules, instructions, and 
procedures.

waived sections 96.7(a), 96.15(a)(2)-(3), 96.15(b)(2)-(3), 96.45(b), 96.53(g), and 96.57(d) of the Commission’s rules 
to allow:  (1) DPA-enabled SASs to authorize both Category A and Category B CBSDs in the 3.5 GHz band prior to 
ESC deployment and certification; and (2) DPA-enabled SASs to be certified without being tested for compliance 
with phase one Exclusion Zone requirements in areas where NTIA has published DPAs.

•RED must comply with all instructions issued by WTB and OET pursuant to sections 
0.241(j) and 0.331(f) of the Commission’s rules.20
•RED must promptly respond to any Commission, WTB, Enforcement Bureau, or OET 
requests for additional information.
•During ICD, each conditionally approved SAS must promptly deactivate, or make 
changes in the operational parameters of any CBSD or group of CBSDs, if directed to do 
so by the Commission, WTB, OET, or Enforcement Bureau.  If, during ICD, a SAS is 
continually shown to cause interference to incumbents, WTB/OET may require that SAS 
to cease all operations until the underlying issues are resolved.
7. In addition, consistent with the ICD Proposals Public Notice and RED’s ICD proposal, 
RED must satisfy the following requirements during ICD:
•RED must demonstrate that users can register with its SAS, receive authentication, and 
obtain user IDs during ICD.21
•RED must demonstrate how its SAS will communicate with and manage multiple CBSD 
or Domain Proxy (DP) products, including the protocols for SAS-CBSD communications 
for registration, channel grant, and channel release.22  RED must identify all of its 
commercial partners that will operate during ICD.
•RED must demonstrate that a certified professional installer (CPI) can register 
CBSDs/DPs during ICD and must explain how that professional installation will ensure 
its SAS can accurately locate devices in compliance with part 96.23  
•RED must demonstrate that its SAS can access, read, and use data directly from FCC 
databases during ICD.24
•RED must demonstrate its ability to correctly synchronize and exchange information with 
other SASs and to correctly apply information security procedures and incumbent 
protection methods during ICD.25  
•RED must demonstrate the processes that it will use to ensure the correct implementation 
of all relevant interference protection criteria, including how its SAS’s over-the-air 
propagation testing addresses the protection of Fixed Satellite Service earth station sites, 
federal inland radar test sites, and area-based protections.26  RED should include the 
results of these protection tests in its ICD Report consistent with its approved final ICD 
deployment plan.

22 See, e.g., 47 CFR §§ 96.39, 96.55-59.  ICD will not need to cover all test cases performed in ITS lab testing.
23 See 3.5 GHz First Report & Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 4028, para. 220 (stressing the importance of accurate CBSD 
geo-location for coordinating interactions between and among users in the band and for protecting Incumbent Users 
from harmful interference in compliance with Part 96).  WinnForum has developed standards and a program to 
approve CPIs that successfully complete their training in the relevant Part 96 rules and the associated technical best 
practices, per the Commission’s strong encouragement to multi-stakeholder groups and industry associations in the

•If RED is DPA-enabled, RED must demonstrate the ability to implement notification-
based DPA protection using a DPA portal.27
•RED must provide a method by which WTB, Enforcement Bureau, OET, NTIA, and 
DoD will have access to its SAS and data generated by its SAS during ICD in order to 
verify that its SAS complies with the relevant rules.  RED must also provide a primary 
point of contact to address questions about SAS operations or information from the 
Commission, NTIA, and the DoD.
•RED must demonstrate real-world application of interference reporting and timely 
interference mitigation processes, including providing FCC enforcement personnel with 
access to SAS data upon request.28  
•Once RED completes its ICD, it must submit an ICD Report to the Commission, 
according to its approved proposal format and including a demonstration of compliance 
with these conditions, as well as any outstanding issues identified in RED’s lab test 
report.29  
8.  These conditions will ensure that RED will comply with the Commission’s rules.  RED 
will not receive final certification unless the conditions described in this Public Notice are met, and such 
certification may be revoked at any time if RED fails to comply with the Commission’s rules and 
guidance on an ongoing basis. 
IV. NEXT STEPS
9. WTB/OET will carefully oversee RED’s operations during the ICD period.  WTB/OET, 
in coordination with NTIA and the DoD, will review RED’s ICD Report and will publicly announce if 
RED successfully completes ICD and receives final certification to operate a SAS.  
10. After RED submits its ICD Report to the Commission, it may continue Initial 
Commercial Deployment, subject to the conditions described in this Public Notice, during the review 
period and pending further Commission review.  RED may expand operations seven business days after 
providing notice to the Commission, provided that such notice includes all information required by the 
ICD Proposals Public Notice.  All ICD deployments must comply with all conditions listed in this Public 
Notice and contained in the ICD Proposals Public Notice.30
11. If RED successfully completes ICD and receives final certification to operate, it will be 
allowed to make its SAS available for commercial use for the five-year term specified in our rules.31  
WTB/OET will publicly announce the availability of each SAS, at which time the five-year term will 
commence.
V. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 
12. RED must file: (1) ICD Reports and any supplements; and (2) ICD notifications with the 
Commission using the Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System.32  See Electronic Filing of

RURAL DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY FUND SUPPORT AUTHORIZED
FOR 1,764 WINNING BIDS; ETHERIC COMMUNICATIONS LLC’S PETITION FOR 
WAIVER OF THE JUNE 7, 2021 ELIGIBLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER 
DOCUMENTATION DEADLINE DENIED
AU Docket No. 20-34
WC Docket No. 19-126
WC Docket No. 10-90
By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB), in conjunction with the Office of 
Economics and Analytics (OEA), authorizes Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (Auction 904) support for 
the winning bids identified in Attachment A of this Public Notice.  We also dismiss as moot and 
alternatively deny Etheric Communications LLC’s (Etheric) petition for waiver of the June 7, 2021 
deadline requiring each Rural Digital Opportunity Fund long-form applicant to demonstrate, with 
appropriate documentation, that it has been designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) in 
each of the geographic areas for which it seeks to be authorized for Auction 904 support.1
1 47 CFR § 54.804(b)(5); Etheric Communications, LLC Petition for Waiver of Section 54.804(b)(3) of the 
Commission’s Rules, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. (filed May 12, 2021) (Etheric ETC Petition).  We note that despite 
Etheric’s reference to rule 54.804(b)(3) (letter of credit commitment letter) in its request, based on the context of the 
request, WCB has determined the applicant actually seeks waiver of rule 54.804(b)(5) regarding the ETC 
designation deadline.  
Generally, the Commission’s rules may be waived for good cause shown.  47 CFR § 1.3.  Waiver of the 
Commission’s rules is appropriate only if both: (1) special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule 
and (2) such deviation will serve the public interest.  See Northeast Cellular Tel. Co. v. FCC, 897 F.2d 1164, 1166 
(D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing WAIT Radio v. FCC, 418 F.2d 1153, 1157-59 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 93 S.Ct. 
461(1972)).  
On December 15, 2022, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a decision denying Etheric’s 
request for an ETC designation covering its Auction 904 winning bids in the state.  California Public Utilities 
Commission, Application of Etheric Communications, LCC for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity 
to Provide Full Facilities-Based and Resold Competitive Local Exchange and Non-Dominant Interexchange Service 
and Designation as an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier in California, Application 21-01-002, Decision Granting 
Etheric a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity in Order to Provide Full Facilities-Based and Resold 
Competitive Local Exchange Services and Resold Interexchange Services but Denying Designation as an Eligible 
Telecommunications Carrier, Decision 22-12-026 (Dec. 15, 2022).  Because Etheric has been unable to obtain an 
ETC designation covering its winning bid areas in California, Etheric cannot be authorized to receive Auction 904 
support in those areas.  See Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Auction et al., AU Docket No. 20-34 et al., Order, DA 
22-912 (WCB/OEA Aug. 31, 2022) (dismissing California Internet, L.P. dba GeoLinks and Cal.Net, Inc.’s petitions 
for waiver as moot after the CPUC denied their requests for ETC designation).  
In addition and in the alternative, we deny Etheric’s petition for waiver on the merits.  See Letter from Stephen E. 
Coran, Counsel to Etheric Communications LLC, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, AU Docket No. 20-34 et 
al. (filed Dec. 21, 2022) (claiming that “Etheric is considering its options to respond to the CPUC Decision and

For each of the winning bids identified in Attachment A, we have reviewed the long-form 
application information, including the letter(s) of credit and Bankruptcy Code opinion letter(s) from the 
long-form applicant’s legal counsel.  Based on the representations and certifications in the relevant long-
form application, we authorize and obligate support for the winning bids listed in Attachment A.
We will also soon post a state-level summary under the “Results” tab on the Auction 904 
webpage at https://www.fcc.gov/auction/904/round-results.  The summary will provide for each long-
form applicant included in this Public Notice:  1) the total support amount over 10 years and total number 
of locations that the long-form applicant is being authorized for in each state; 2) the total number of 
locations to which the authorized support recipient must offer the required voice and broadband services 
for each performance tier and latency in each state; and 3) the eligible census blocks included in the 
winning bids that are being authorized in each state.
Upon issuance of this Public Notice, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) is 
authorized and directed to take the steps necessary to disburse from the Universal Service Fund the 
amounts identified in Attachment A to the long-form applicant associated with each study area specified 
in Attachment A.  Payments will be to the account on file for the 498 ID associated with the study area 
code (SAC).  The support will be disbursed in 120 monthly payments, which will begin at the end of this 
month. 
Below, we provide a summary of the various obligations of authorized Auction 904 support 
recipients.  The list below is not a comprehensive list; thus, each support recipient is still responsible for 
conducting the due diligence required to comply with universal service fund requirements and the 
Commission’s rules. 
Summary of Obligations and Relevant Dates.  All Auction 904 authorized long-form applicants 
are subject to the following requirements: 
•Annual reporting of location information.  Auction 904 support recipients are required to file 
location information with USAC through the High-Cost Universal Broadband (HUBB) portal.2  
This information includes geolocation data for each qualifying location to which they are offering 
the requisite service and the technology the Auction 904 support recipient is using to offer the 
requisite service to the qualifying locations.3  The requisite service is at least one standalone voice 
plan and one service plan that provides broadband at the relevant performance tier, and latency 
further proceedings to obtain ETC status in California”).  Although Etheric filed its petition within the 30-day 
window for presuming good faith efforts, we find that it would not serve the public interest to delay action on 
Etheric’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund application indefinitely after the CPUC has already denied Etheric’s ETC 
petition and while Etheric considers its options for moving forward.  Etheric ETC Petition at 2; Rural Digital 
Opportunity Fund et al., WC Docket No. 19-126 et al., Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 686, 723, para. 81 (2020) 
(Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order).  Numerous federal and state programs have been established or are being 
established to promote and fund broadband deployment.  By denying Etheric’s petition, we open the relevant areas 
covered by Etheric’s Auction 904 winning bids up to eligibility for future funding programs to the extent they 
remain unserved, rather than tying up these areas for an indefinite period of time with no indication that Etheric will 
ultimately obtain an ETC designation from California. 
Accordingly, we also dismiss Etheric’s petition for waiver of the deadline to submit audited financial statements as 
moot.  47 CFR § 54.804(b)(4); Etheric Communications, LLC Petition for Waiver of Section 54.804(b)(4) of the 
Commission’s Rules, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. (filed June 4, 2021).  Etheric filed its audited financial statements 
on July 27, 2021.  Etheric Communications, LLC, Supplement to Petition for Waiver, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al. 
(filed July 27, 2021).  The Bureau will release a public notice in the near future announcing Etheric’s default in 
these areas.

requirements at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates offered in urban areas.4  The 
locations must be in the eligible census blocks covered by the long-form applicant’s winning 
bids.5  
The Commission has consistently encouraged carriers subject to defined deployment obligations and 
HUBB reporting obligations to report location data on a rolling basis and has adopted a best practice of 
filing this information within 30 days after the initial offering of service.6  While reporting on a rolling 
basis is encouraged, the first deadline for long-form applicants authorized by this Public Notice to submit 
their location data is March 1, 2024.7  All support recipients must continue to report this information by 
March 1 in each year thereafter until all build-out requirements are satisfied.  For more information about 
the HUBB portal and reporting location data, visit https://www.usac.org/high-cost/annual-
requirements/submit-data-in-the-hubb/.
 
•Service milestones.  The service milestones for Auction 904 support recipients authorized by this 
Public Notice will be as follows:8
4 47 CFR § 54.805; Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 707, para. 42.  See also Wireline

Voice and Broadband Services, Posting of Survey Data and Explanatory Notes, and Required Minimum Usage 
Allowance for Eligible Telecommunications Carriers, WC Docket No. 10-90, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 13667 
(WCB/OEA 2020).  We remind all applicants that an eligible telecommunications carrier (ETC) satisfies its 
obligation to “offer” qualifying services by being legally responsible for dealing with customer problems, providing 
quality of service guarantees, and meeting universal service fund-related requirements.  Accordingly, a broadband 
provider may satisfy its voice obligations by offering voice service through an affiliate or by offering a managed 
voice solution (including VoIP) through a third-party vendor, but a provider cannot simply rely on the availability of 
over-the-top voice options to satisfy this obligation.  Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I Auction Scheduled for 
October 29, 2020; Notice and Filing Requirements and Other Procedures for Auction 904, AU Docket No. 20-34 et

Regarding their Broadband Location Reporting Obligations, Public Notice, 31 FCC Rcd 12900 (WCB 2016) 
(Location Guidance Public Notice).
6 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 712, para. 56 & n.156.  A support recipient is deemed to be 
commercially offering voice and/or broadband service to a location if it provides service to the location or could 
provide it within 10 business days upon request.  Id. at 711-12, para. 54.
7 47 CFR § 54.316(c)(1).  On our own motion we waive the March 1, 2023 deadline for applicants authorized by this 
Public Notice.  We find special circumstances warrant waiver because these applicants are being authorized less 
than two months prior to the March 1, 2023 HUBB filing date.  We also conclude that the waiver will serve the 
public interest because it will allow USAC sufficient time to make modifications to the HUBB to incorporate the 
applicants’ information.  Therefore, the first deadline for annual location reporting for these applicants is March 1, 
2024, although we continue to encourage reporting on a rolling basis as a best practice.
8 47 CFR § 54.802; Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 709-12, paras. 45-55.  In the 13th Ready 
to Authorize Public Notice, we found good cause to grant a limited waiver of section 54.802(c)(1) of the 
Commission’s rules to require the applicants with winning bids being authorized by this Public Notice to meet the 
same service milestones as all Auction 904 support recipients that were authorized in 2022.  Rural Digital

WCB has been directed to publish revised location counts before the end of service milestone 
year six.9  In areas where the revised location total is higher than the number of Connect America 
Cost Model (CAM)-calculated locations, support recipients will be required to have begun 
commercially offering service to 100% of the CAM-calculated location count by the end of the 
sixth calendar year.10  Such support recipients must then offer service to 100% of the revised 
location count by the end of the eighth calendar year.11  In areas where there are fewer locations 
than calculated by the CAM, support recipients must notify WCB no later than March 1 following 
the fifth year of deployment.12  Upon confirmation by WCB, such a support recipient will be 
required to reach 100% of the new number by the end of the sixth calendar year.13  All support 
recipients must also offer service on reasonable request to locations built subsequently to the 
revised location count announced by WCB but prior to the end of service milestone year eight.14
By March 1st following each relevant service milestone, an Auction 904 support recipient must 
file a certification in the HUBB portal that it has met its service milestone and is meeting the 
requisite public interest obligations.15  Compliance with service milestones will be determined at 
the state level.16  The Commission will verify that the support recipient offers the required service 
to the total number of locations across all the eligible census blocks included in all of the support

10 Id. at 710, para. 49.  Carriers for which the new location count exceeds the CAM locations within their area in 
each state by more than 35% will have the opportunity to seek additional support or relief from the Commission.  Id. 
11 Id.  Any such support recipient with increased deployment obligations may also seek to have its new location 
count adjusted to exclude additional locations, beyond the number identified by the CAM, that it determines before 
the end of year eight are ineligible (e.g., are not habitable), unreasonable to deploy to (e.g., if it would require a 
carrier to install new backhaul facilities or other major network upgrades solely to provide broadband to that 
location), or part of a development newly built after year six for which the cost and/or time to deploy before the end 
of the support term would be unreasonable.  Id. at 710-11, para. 50.
12 Id. at 711, para. 51.  Carriers for which the new location count is less than 65% of the CAM locations within their 
area in each state shall have their support amount reduced on a pro rata basis by the number of reduced locations.  
Id.  For example, if a carrier was authorized to receive $3 million per year for 1,000 model locations in a state, but 
the WCB confirms that there are only 600 actual locations (fewer than 650 locations, or 65%), WCB would reduce 
that carrier’s support to $2,769,231 (or $3,000,000 * (600/650)).
13 Id.  
14 Id. at 711, para. 52.  Support recipients are not obligated to offer service to newly built locations that do not 
request service, or to those with exclusive arrangements with other providers.  Id.  See also Connect America Fund 
et al., Report and Order et al., 29 FCC Rcd 7051, 7070, paras. 59-72 (2014) (issuing declaratory ruling regarding 
which requests should be deemed unreasonable under our current rules and policies to provide greater clarity to all 
affected stakeholders).

recipient’s authorized bid areas (i.e., census block groups) in a state.17  If a support recipient is 
authorized to receive support in a state for different performance tier and latency combinations, it 
will be required to demonstrate that it is offering service meeting the relevant performance 
requirements to the required number of locations for each performance tier and latency 
combination within that state.18  
If an ETC is unable to meet a service milestone, it must notify the Commission, USAC, and the 
relevant state, U.S. Territory, or Tribal government as appropriate, no later than ten business days 
after the applicable deadline.19  If the ETC is unable to meet the required deployment obligations 
due to circumstances beyond its control, it may also seek waiver of the service milestones.20  The 
Commission has repeatedly warned support recipients, however, that it does not expect to 
routinely grant such waiver requests, emphasizing the difficulty of demonstrating good cause 
under circumstances where carriers fail to plan for contingencies that would prevent compliance 
with defined deployment obligations.21
•Annual section 54.313 report.  Long-form applicants authorized in this Public Notice will be 
required to file their first annual section 54.313 report by July 1, 2024 and each subsequent year 
until the year after their support terms have ended.22  Annual reports are filed with USAC.  
Support recipients must complete the FCC Form 481 on USAC’s website.23  They must also test 
and certify compliance with relevant performance requirements in section 54.805 of the 
Commission’s rules on an annual basis.24  WCB, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, and 
the Office of Engineering and Technology have adopted a uniform framework to measure and 
report on the performance of ETCs’ service.25
17 Winning bidders must use Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support to deploy service to locations in only the 
eligible census blocks, not to the other, ineligible census blocks within a census block group won in the auction.

•Annual section 54.314 certification.  The first annual section 54.314 certification is due for the 
long-form applicants that are being authorized by this Public Notice by October 1, 2024.26  
Pursuant to section 54.314 of the Commission’s rules, if a support recipient was designated by a 
state, that state must certify on the support recipient’s behalf “that all federal high-cost support 
provided . . . within that State was used in the preceding calendar year and will be used in the 
coming calendar year only for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities and 
services for which the support is intended.”27  
If a support recipient was designated an ETC by the Federal Communications Commission, it 
must self-certify by filing a sworn affidavit executed by a corporate officer attesting to the 
relevant facts.28  Certifications must be filed with both the Commission and USAC.  ETCs may 
submit their certifications to USAC via its online filing system or by sending the appropriate 
certification sample letter (provided on USAC’s website) via email or U.S. mail.29  Certifications 
must also be submitted to the Commission’s Office of the Secretary on or before October 1, 
2024.30  The submission should clearly reference WC Docket No. 14-58, ETC Annual Reports 
and Certifications.  
All post-designation ETC-related filings must be submitted in good faith and include a 
certification that, to the best of the ETC’s knowledge and belief, the information is complete and 
accurate.31  In addition, ETCs have an on-going duty to correct or amend information if they have reason 
to believe, either through their own investigation or upon notice from USAC, that the data are inaccurate, 
incomplete, or contain errors or anomalies.32  The failure to timely file information may result in penalties 
in the form of a reduction in support.33
National Security Supply Chain Proceeding. We remind winning bidders that all Auction 904 
support recipients will be subject to the Commission’s National Security Supply Chain proceeding, 
including the rule that “no universal service support may be used to purchase, obtain, maintain, improve, 
modify, or otherwise support any equipment or services produced or provided by any company posing a 
national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply 
chain.”34  The prohibition on using universal service funds applies “to upgrades and maintenance of

29 See Universal Service Administrative Company, Certify Data with 54.314, https://www.usac.org/high-
cost/annual-requirements/certify-data-with-54-314/.
30 For the reasons articulated in the First Auction 904 Authorization Public Notice, we find there is good cause to 
waive on our own motion the general high-cost program requirement that the relevant states (or the ETCs, if 
applicable) file a section 54.314 certification by October 1, 2023 with respect to the use of Auction 904 support for 
the applicants authorized in this Public Notice.  Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Support Authorized for 466 
Winning Bids, AU Docket No. 20-34 et al., Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 13574, 13578 (WCB/OEA 2021). 
31 See, e.g., FCC Form 481 Officer Certification (requiring an officer of a petitioning entity to certify that he/she is 
“an officer of the reporting carrier; my responsibilities include ensuring the accuracy of the annual reporting 
requirements for universal service support recipients; and, to the best of my knowledge, the information reported on 
this form and in any attachments is accurate”); see also 47 CFR § 1.17(a)(2) (stating that no person may provide, in 
any written statement of fact, “material factual information that is incorrect or omit material information that is 
necessary to prevent any material factual statement that is made from being incorrect or misleading without a 
reasonable basis for believing that any such material factual statement is correct and not misleading”).

existing equipment and services.”35  Additionally, federal subsidies made available through a program 
administered by the Commission that are “to be used for the capital expenditures necessary for the 
provision of advanced communications service” cannot be used to “purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise 
obtain any covered communications equipment or service; or maintain any covered communications 
equipment or service.”36  Moreover, the Commission will require ETCs to certify prior to receiving 
universal service funds that they do not use covered communications equipment or services.37  
Document Retention and Compliance Audits.  Under section 54.320 of the Commission’s rules, 
recipients of high-cost support must retain, for at least ten years, all records necessary to demonstrate to 
auditors that the support received was consistent with universal service high-cost program rules and to 
make these documents available upon request to the Commission (and any of its Bureaus or Offices) and 
to USAC, and to their respective auditors.38  In addition, all ETCs that receive high-cost support are 
subject to random compliance audits and other investigations to ensure compliance with program rules 
and orders, including verification of actual deployment to reported locations.39
Consequences for Non-Compliance.  A support recipient is subject to non-compliance measures 
once it becomes a support recipient if it fails or is unable to meet its minimum coverage requirement or 
other service requirements, or if it fails to fulfill any other term or condition of Auction 904 support.40  
These measures scale with the extent of non-compliance and include additional reporting, withholding of 
support, and support recovery.41  A defaulting support recipient may also be subject to sanctions, 
including, but not limited to, potential revocation of ETC designations and suspension or debarment.42 
ETC Obligations.  All Auction 904 support recipients were required to obtain a high-cost ETC 
designation prior to being authorized for Auction 904 support, and thus should be familiar with ETC 
requirements.  For example, all high-cost ETCs commit to serving the entire area covered by an ETC 
designation and must offer Lifeline voice and broadband service throughout such area to qualifying low-
income consumers pursuant to the Lifeline program rules.43  While an Auction 904 support recipient was 
not required to obtain an ETC designation that was limited only to the eligible census blocks covered by 
its winning bids, it may only use its Auction 904 support to offer the required voice and broadband 
services to locations in eligible census blocks.  If an Auction 904 support recipient has obtained an ETC

designation that covers more area than the eligible census blocks in its winning bids, that support 
recipient has the obligation to provide Lifeline services throughout its designated service area, including 
in areas where it cannot use its Auction 904 support.44  A high-cost ETC may also be subject to state-
specific requirements imposed by the state that designated it as an ETC.
Discontinuance of Service and/or Relinquishment of Support.  It is a violation of Commission 
rules to receive universal service support if that support is not used to provide, maintain, and upgrade 
voice and/or broadband facilities and services in eligible areas or if the recipient is no longer offering 
supported services.  A carrier that cannot appropriately use universal service support must relinquish its 
ETC designation pursuant to section 214(e)(4) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the 
Communications Act).45  An ETC that was designated by a state commission should follow the state 
commission’s rules to seek relinquishment.46  ETCs designated by the Commission must file a notice of 
relinquishment in WC Docket No. 09-197, Telecommunications Carriers Eligible for Universal Service 
Support, using the Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS).47  WCB will release an 
order approving the relinquishment if the relinquishing ETC demonstrates that the affected area will 
continue to be served by at least one ETC.48  The ETC must then send a copy of its relinquishment notice 
and a copy of the relinquishment order (within one week of its release) to USAC at hcorders@usac.org.  
A carrier that intends to discontinue service must first obtain authorization to discontinue service pursuant 
to section 214(a) of the Communications Act and section 63.71 of the Commission’s rules.49
Transfers of Control.  ETCs seeking to transfer control of their domestic authorizations to operate 
pursuant to section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or to engage in the sale of 
assets under section 214 must first receive approval from the Commission in accordance with sections 
63.03 and 63.04 of the Commission’s rules governing the procedures for domestic transfer of 
control/asset applications.50  Transfers of control and assignments of international section 214 
authorizations are separately subject to section 63.24 of the Commission’s rules.51  Except where the 
Commission has forborne from the application of section 214, this requirement applies to all transfers of 
control or asset acquisitions involving ETCs.  More information is available on the Commission’s website 
at http://www.fcc.gov/general/transfer-control.  
Price Cap Carrier Obligations.  Price cap carriers that serve the census blocks where an Auction 
904 long-form applicant that is not the incumbent price cap carrier has been authorized to receive support 
will no longer have a federal high-cost ETC obligation to continue to offer voice service in those census 
blocks pursuant to the forbearance granted by the Commission.  We also note that price cap carriers that 
44 For example, some Auction 904 support recipients may have obtained an ETC designation for an entire census 
block group(s) that was covered by its winning bid(s) but may only use its Auction 904 support to offer service to 
locations in the eligible census blocks within the census block group(s).

elected to receive a seventh year of model-based support were already relieved of their federal high-cost 
ETC obligation to offer voice telephony in specific census blocks on January 1, 2022.52
Transitioning Legacy Support.  WCB will soon update the list of census blocks where incumbent 
price cap carriers will continue to receive legacy support through the disaggregated legacy high-cost 
support mechanism by removing the eligible census blocks that are covered by the winning bids in 
Attachment A.53  In the census blocks removed from the list, incumbent price cap carriers will no longer 
receive legacy support beginning on the first day of the next month.54 
Auction Defaults.  On July 26, 2021, the Rural Broadband Auctions Task Force (RBATF), WCB, 
and OEA sent a letter to certain long-form applicants that identified census blocks where concerns had 
been raised about whether funding those areas would be the best use of our limited universal service 
funds.55  Applicants were reminded that one of the Commission’s core Universal Service Fund policy 
objectives is to avoid funding deployment in areas that already receive voice and broadband service from 
an unsubsidized provider, and that the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund was intended to focus on areas 
“wholly unserved by 25/3 Mbps” broadband service.56  The letter recommended that applicants assess 
whether existing service in the identified areas would affect their ability to meet all program requirements 
and deployment milestones, and applicants were informed that if they no longer wished to pursue support 
for a winning bid they should identify those census block groups and provide a brief explanation of their 
decision to default on their bid(s).57  
In response to the letter, some applicants informed the Commission that they wished to default on 
census blocks identified by the Commission in the letter while retaining support for other census blocks 
within the same bid.  For these applicants, Attachment A authorizes support only for the areas in which 
the applicant indicated they intend to meet program requirements.58 
52 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 743-45, paras. 133-39.  On the first day of the month after 
an Auction 904 support recipient that is not the incumbent price cap carrier is authorized, the incumbent price cap 
carrier will be relieved of its federal high-cost ETC obligation to offer voice telephony in those specific census 
blocks unless it was relieved of that obligation on January 1, 2022.  Id. at 745, para. 139.  See also December 2014 
Connect America Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 15663–71, paras. 50-70; 47 CFR § 54.201(d)(3).  We will remove these 
census blocks as applicable from the list of census blocks where price cap carriers continue to have the federal high-
cost ETC obligation to provide voice service.  The “List of Census Blocks Subject to Federal High-Cost Voice 
Obligations” is available at https://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/price-cap-resources.  
53 Connect America Fund et al., WC Docket No. 10-90, Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd 807, 809-12, paras. 9-16 
(2019).  Incumbent price cap carriers were also given the option of declining legacy support in each state that they 
serve.  See Wireline Competition Bureau Announces Universal Service Support Amounts Offered to Price Cap 
Carriers and Fixed Competitive Eligible Telecommunications Carriers after Authorization of Connect America 
Phase II Auction Support, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 1296 (WCB 2019). 
54 Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 738-40 (stating that price cap carriers will no longer 
receive legacy support for the census blocks where Auction 904 support is authorized beginning on the first day of

58 For the reasons articulated in the Fourth RDOF Authorization Public Notice regarding defaults on letter-identified 
census blocks, we find good cause to waive the requirement that a default encompass the entire winning bid, and we 
authorize support on a per-census-block basis for the census blocks in which applicants listed in Attachment A are 
eligible.  Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Support Authorized for 2,008 Winning Bids, AU Docket No. 20-34, WC

I. INTRODUCTION
The Federal Communications Commission’s (Commission’s) biennial commercial and noncommercial 
broadcast ownership reporting forms—FCC Form 323 and Form 323-E, respectively—are designed to 
obtain detailed ownership information from the broadcast industry.  This report, which presents data on 
ownership interests in commercial and noncommercial broadcast stations as of October 1, 2021 by 
gender, race, and ethnicity,1 is the latest in a series of such publicly released tabulations.  On November 
14, 2012, the Media Bureau released the first electronic analysis of commercial broadcast ownership data 
submitted pursuant to the revised biennial reporting requirements for 2009 and 2011.2  Subsequent reports 
contained analyses of the commercial broadcast ownership data submitted during the 2013, 2015, 2017, 
and 2019 filing cycles.3  Accordingly, this report presents a tabulation of the seventh data collection using 
the current version of Form 323 and the third data collection using the current version of Form 323-E.4  
Like the prior reports, the data contained in these reports  are “snapshots” of the status of minority and 
female ownership in the broadcast industry taken every two years.  The collection, tabulation, and release 
of these data are useful to the public, Congress, and the Commission because they provide an insight into 
the ownership of broadcast stations, both commercial and noncommercial, over time, that could be 
relevant to the Commission’s policymaking as well as used by interested parties.5 
This report covers commercial and noncommercial stations in five broadcast services—full power 
television, Class A television, low power television, AM radio, and FM radio.  As of October 1, 2021, 
1 The Media Bureau’s previous Report presented data on commercial broadcast stations as reported in the 2019 
filing cycle.  See Fifth Report on Ownership of Broadcast Stations, FCC Form 323 and Form 323-E Ownership Data 
as of October 1, 2019 (MB, OEA 2021), https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-21-1101A1.pdf (Fifth 323 and 
323-E Report).

Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 et al., Report on Ownership of 
Commercial Broadcast Stations, 27 FCC Rcd 13814, 13815, para. 2 (2012).

Ownership of Commercial Broadcast Stations, 29 FCC Rcd 7835, 7836, para. 2 (2014).
4 In 2009, the Commission made significant revisions to the ownership reporting form for commercial broadcast 
stations to improve the accuracy and reliability of collected biennial ownership data and allow that data to be 
searched, aggregated, and cross-referenced electronically.  See, e.g., Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the 
Broadcasting Services et al., Report and Order, Second Report and Order, and Order on Reconsideration, 31 FCC 
Rcd 398, 400-01, paras. 4-6 (2016) (2016 323 and 323-E Order).  In 2016, the Commission revised the ownership 
reporting form for noncommercial broadcast stations, Form 323-E, to align the reporting requirements for 
noncommercial stations more closely with those for commercial stations.  See id. at 420-28, paras. 43-55; see also 
Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services et al., Order on Reconsideration, 32 FCC Rcd 
3440 (2017) (2017 323-E Order on Reconsideration) (further revising noncommercial filing requirements).  
Pursuant to the 2016 323 and 323-E Order , noncommercial stations are now required to submit biennial ownership 
reports on the same schedule applicable to commercial stations, including the October 1 “as of” date.  See 2016 323 
and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 432-33, paras. 64-67.  Such filings were submitted by noncommercial licensees 
for the first time as part of the 2017 biennial filing cycle.  See id. at 429, 432, paras. 58, 66; Promoting 
Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services, Order, 31 FCC Rcd 13263, 13263-64, paras. 1-2 (MB 
2016) (suspending rolling filing deadlines for noncommercial stations and instead requiring all such stations to file 
on or before December 1, 2017).
5 The information in this report meets the Commission’s information quality guidelines.  See Implementation of 
Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Pursuant to 
Section 515 of Public Law No. 105-554, Information Quality Guidelines, 17 FCC Rcd 19890 (2002).
203                                                    Federal Communications Commission                              DA 23-35
there were approximately 1,760 licensed full power television stations, 380 licensed Class A television 
stations, 1,740 licensed low power television stations, 4,520 licensed AM radio stations, and 10,890 
licensed FM radio stations.  
This report focuses on two aspects of the recently collected ownership data—“attributable” ownership 
interests and “majority” ownership interests—using the lenses of gender, race, and ethnicity.6  First, the 
report analyzes the reported information concerning attributable interest holders, consistent with the 
Commission’s broadcast ownership attribution rules.7  Those rules represent the Commission’s best 
judgment concerning when an interest is sufficient to confer on the owner a potential degree of influence 
over a licensee that should be cognizable for purposes of applying the Commission’s broadcast ownership 
rules.  As a general matter, the Commission for decades has deemed officers and directors of licensee 
entities, as well as holders of 5% or more voting interests, to be attributable owners.8  Within this rubric, 
the report considers the gender, race, and ethnicity of attributable ownership interest holders.  In graphs 
and tables reporting attributable ownership interests, the gender, race, and ethnicity categories are not 
mutually exclusive.  Each station may appear in multiple gender, race, and ethnicity categories because 
many stations have attributable interest holders who belong to different gender, racial, or ethnic groups.  
For example, a station with both male and female attributable interest holders would be counted in both 
the male and female categories.
Second, the report adapts a measure the Commission often employs in ownership analyses generally, the 
majority ownership interest.  In those other contexts, the Commission pays heed to whether a station’s 
attributable ownership ranks include a party that holds more than 50% of a station’s voting interests, 
because of the degree of influence that entity likely would have over station operations and decision-
making.9  Along the same lines, this report considers whether a person or group of people sharing the 
same gender, race or ethnicity characteristics collectively hold more than 50% of the voting interests in a 
licensee.  For example , a station’s majority ownership interest in gender would be female if a single 
woman or a group of women held more than 50% of the voting interests in the licensee.  A station’s 
majority interest in race and ethnicity is determined in the same way.  Notably, some stations do not have 
a discernable majority interest on the basis of gender, race, or ethnicity.10  Such stations are classified as 
having “No Majority Interest.”  
6 Following government standards, the report employs two gender classifications (male and female), six racial 
classifications (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other 
Pacific Islander, Two or more races, and White), and two ethnic classifications (Hispanic/Latino and not 
Hispanic/Latino). The gender, race, and ethnicity categories identified in Forms 323 and 323-E follow the guidance 
provided by the Office of Management and Budget.  See  Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal 
Data on Race and Ethnicity, Notice of Decision, 62 Fed. Reg. 58,782 (Oct. 30, 1997).  See Appendix A for the 
definitions of each racial and ethnic classification.

decades-old form).
10 The next section presents more detail about the two measures of ownership used in this report, attributable 
ownership interest and majority ownership interest.  In addition, the following section discusses the reasons why a 
station may have no discernable majority ownership interest in one of the demographic categories.

Overview of 2021 Broadcast Station Ownership Data  
The shares of stations held by the various classifications reported below are calculated on the basis of the 
number of stations filing usable data, not on the basis of the total number of licensed stations.11  
Figure 1 below summarizes the majority ownership interest of all commercial broadcast stations in 
gender, race, and ethnicity.  Women held a majority ownership interest in 9% of commercial broadcast 
stations, while men held a majority ownership interest in 61% of commercial broadcast stations.  White 
persons held a majority ownership interest in 73% of commercial broadcast stations, while persons 
belonging to racial minority groups held a majority ownership interest in 4% of commercial broadcast 
stations.  Finally, Hispanic/Latino persons held a majority ownership interest in 6% of commercial 
broadcast stations while non-Hispanic/Latino persons held a majority ownership interest in 70% of 
commercial broadcast stations.
Figure 2 below summarizes the majority ownership interest of all noncommercial broadcast stations by 
gender, race, and ethnicity.  Women held a majority ownership interest in 15% of noncommercial 
broadcast stations, while men held a majority ownership interest in 77% of noncommercial broadcast 
stations.  White persons held a majority ownership interest in 93% of noncommercial broadcast stations, 
while persons belonging to racial minority groups held a majority ownership interest in 3% of 
noncommercial broadcast stations.  Finally, Hispanic/Latino persons held a majority ownership interest in 
11 Information regarding the usable reports for each respective service is contained in the relevant tables below. 
Recognizing that there are certain limited instances where a non-profit entity holds a commercial license—and 
therefore parts of Form 323 may be inapplicable to the entity’s structure—the Commission permits such an entity to 
file Form 323-E instead of Form 323.  See  2016 323 and 323-E Order , 31 FCC Rcd at 423-24, para. 48 n.175.  All 
stations that filed Form 323-E are treated as noncommercial for purposes of this report.
205                                                    Federal Communications Commission                              DA 23-35
3% of noncommercial broadcast stations, while non-Hispanic/Latino persons held a majority ownership 
interest in 94% of noncommercial broadcast stations.
For reference, we also present demographic information for the U.S. population.  In 2021, the U.S. 
population was almost evenly split between men and women.  About 80% of the U.S. population 
identified as not Hispanic/Latino while about 20% identified as Hispanic/Latino.  By race, 61% of the 
U.S. population identified as White, about 12% identified as Black or African American, and about 6% 
identified as Asian.  About 1% of the U.S. population identified as American Indian or Alaska Native and 
a smaller share identified as Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.  About 13% of the U.S. 
population identified as belonging to two or more racial groups and about 7% belonged to some other 
racial group.  In total, just over 40% of the U.S. population identified as belonging to a racial or ethnic 
minority group whereas the share of the U.S. population identifying as White, not Hispanic/Latino was 
about 60%.12

attached tables and appendices, as well as in accompanying spreadsheets released in conjunction with this 
report.13  
II. MEASURES OF OWNERSHIP
A. Attributable Ownership Interest
As noted above, a station’s ownership report must identify all of its attributable interest holders.14  The 
attribution rules represent the Commission’s best judgment concerning when an interest is sufficient to 
confer on the owner a potential degree of influence over a licensee that should be cognizable for purposes 
of applying the Commission’s broadcast ownership rules.  
With regard to corporations, individuals holding voting stock interests in a broadcast licensee of 5% or 
greater are considered attributable interest holders.15  Further, individuals holding particular positions 
within a broadcast licensee entity also are attributable interest holders, regardless of their shares of voting 
stock.  For example, officers and directors of broadcast licensee entities are attributable based on their 
corporate positions, as are members of limited liability companies and partners in a limited or general 
partnership, respectively.16  Consistent with the Commission’s rules, these individuals are deemed to have 
a role in the ownership and control of the broadcast licensee.  Further, these individuals may exercise 
control of a licensee in cases where no single individual holds a majority of the voting interests in that 
licensee and therefore are more likely to exercise such control where no attributable voting interests are 
identified.  This, however, cannot be inferred from the Form 323/323-E data alone, as the specific facts of 
each case would be required to determine actual control.  
In graphs and tables reporting attributable ownership interests, the gender, race, and ethnicity categories 
are not mutually exclusive.  Each station may appear in multiple gender, race, and ethnicity categories 
because many stations have attributable interest holders who belong to different gender, racial, or ethnic 
groups.  For example, a station with both male and female attributable interest holders would be counted 
in both the male and female categories. 
B. Majority Ownership Interest
The report also uses the concept of majority ownership interest to summarize station ownership.  As 
stated above, a station has a majority ownership interest in gender, race, or ethnicity if a single individual 
or a group of individuals belonging to the same gender, racial, or ethnic group hold more than 50% of the 
voting interests in the licensee.  For example, if a single woman or a group of women hold more than 50% 
of voting interests in a licensee, the station’s majority ownership interest in gender is female.  The 
majority ownership interests in race and ethnicity are determined in the same way.  
If there is no gender, racial, or ethnic group whose members hold more than 50% of voting interests, the 
station is classified as having “No Majority Interest.”  Our classification of a licensee in this report as 
having “No Majority Interest” does not necessarily mean that no classification of persons by gender, race, 
or ethnicity has a majority interest in the station, only that these facts could not be determined from the 
13 The accompanying spreadsheets present ownership characteristics for each broadcast station, identified by its 
Facility ID number.  These spreadsheets also provide the current call sign for each broadcast station.  The 
spreadsheets are available at https://www.fcc.gov/biennial-forms-323-and-323-e-broadcast-ownership-data-and-
reports.  
14 See the notes to 47 CFR § 73.3555.
15 Ownership of less than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation, however, is not attributable.  See 47 
CFR § 73.3555, Note 2a.
16 See 47 CFR § 73.3555, Note 2g.  The relevant question on Form 323/323-E identifies the following additional 
categories of positional interests:  General Partner; Limited Partner; LC/LLC/PLLC Member/Owner/Stockholder; 
Attributable Creditor; and Attributable Investor.  The question also provides an “Other” option for users to specify 
an attribution category not contained in our list.  All stations reporting persons identified by any one of these 
categories are included in Tables 1 and 2. 
207                                                    Federal Communications Commission                              DA 23-35
reported Form 323/323-E data in the absence of additional information.  Stations may be classified as 
having no majority interest because some of a licensee’s voting stock are not reported on Form 323 or 
Form 323-E.  This occurs because the Commission does not attribute ownership of a licensee corporation 
to anyone who holds less than 5% of the outstanding voting interest of that corporation.17  Particularly 
where the licensee is a public, widely held entity, it is common for large portions of a licensee’s voting 
stock not to be reported on Form 323/323-E.  In some cases, no attributable voting stock may be reported. 
C. Caveats and Clarifications
This report provides detailed information by gender, race, and ethnicity about the ownership of 
commercial and noncommercial television, radio, Class A television, and LPTV stations.  As with 
previous reports, however, this report tallies and presents the data as provided to the Commission by 
filers.  Therefore, its results ultimately rely on the accuracy and completeness of those filings.    
Users of the information in this report should also bear in mind that while “control” of a licensee in the 
usual parlance of the Commission’s cases, rules, and procedures refers to actual control of the licensee, 
either in terms of de jure  or de facto control by an identifiable individual or group, the tabulation of 
interests in this report focuses on individuals or groups that share self-identified traits, irrespective of 
whether the person or group has de jure or de facto control.  Because the Commission reports interests 
here that are held collectively by certain classes of individuals who may have no connection with one 
another beyond their shared classification by gender, race, or ethnicity, the fact that a particular class of 
individuals may have a majority of the voting stock, membership, or partnership interests in a licensee 
does not necessarily indicate actual control of the licensee by that class of individuals.  Rather, absent a 
single majority interest holder, control of these stations would be determined on a de facto basis, which 
requires access to facts not reported on Form 323.  Accordingly, this report refers to these collective 
interests as “majority” interests, rather than “controlling” interests.  Similarly, where no majority interest 
is reported, a de facto control analysis would be required to determine actual control.  However, when a 
single individual, of whatever classification, holds a majority voting interest in a licensee, this would 
indicate de jure control by that individual and is considered a controlling interest.   
Some parties have suggested that, due to dissimilarities between the governance of commercial and 
noncommercial stations, the concept of “ownership” for noncommercial stations may be less obvious than 
in the context of commercial stations.18  Nonetheless, for both Form 323 (commercial) and Form 323-E 
(noncommercial) purposes, the concept of ownership relies on the attribution standards set forth in 
Section 73.3555 of the Commission’s rules, which generally do not depend on equity interests but instead 
“seek to identify those interests . . . that confer . . . a degree of influence or control such that the holders 
have a realistic potential to affect the programming decisions of licensees or other core operating 
functions.”19  The Commission’s attribution standards apply to both commercial and noncommercial 
stations, because the Commission has concluded that individuals and entities captured by these standards 
have the potential to exert influence over the licensee, regardless of whether the station at issue is 
commercial or noncommercial.20  Officers and directors therefore are attributable owners of the 
noncommercial licensees they serve, and such individuals historically have been reported as attributable 
interest holders on both commercial and noncommercial broadcast ownership reports.21

III. SUMMARY OF RESULTS
This section presents a summary of FCC Form 323 and Form 323-E data by category of ownership 
(attributable ownership interest and majority ownership interest) and by gender, race, and ethnicity. 22  
Results are reported by service.  For clarity and to provide context, we present 2021 figures against the 
backdrop of 2019 figures.  The following summary uses data from the 2021 Form 323 and Form 323-E 
biennial reports, representing information current as of October 1, 2021, and the 2019 Form 323 and 
Form 323-E biennial reports, representing information current as of October 1, 2019.  The share of 
stations held by individuals in the various classifications reported below are calculated on the basis of the 
number of stations filing usable data, not on the basis of the total number of licensed stations.  Stations 
that did not file an ownership report are not included in the majority ownership interest or the attributable 
ownership interest calculations.  In addition, some stations submitted one or more ownership reports, but 
their filings were incomplete.  While these stations are not included in the majority ownership interest 
calculations, attributable interest holders disclosed on reports for these stations are included in the 
attributable ownership interest calculations.  
The first figure for each service reports the share of stations with at least one attributable interest holder 
who belongs to each gender, race, or ethnicity classification.  Each station may appear in more than one 
gender, race, or ethnicity classification.  
The second figure for each service reports the share of stations for which an individual or a group of 
individuals of the same gender, race, or ethnicity hold, either individually or collectively, a majority of the 
voting interests in the licensee, that is, their voting interests exceed 50%.  When a station is identified as 
having no majority interest, that does not necessarily mean that no particular classification of persons has 
a majority interest in the station, only that this cannot be determined from the reported Form 323 or Form 
323-E data as submitted.  In the second figure, each station appears in only one gender, race, and ethnicity 
classification.  Joint female/male is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female 
attributable owners and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners both separately exceed 50% 
(e.g., a station where a female and a male each own 100% of the station as joint tenants).
The information summarized graphically is provided in Appendix B in a series of tables presenting the 
sources of ownership attribution.  Detailed information, including market size data, is contained in the 
tables in Appendix B and in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets released in conjunction with this 
report.

https://www.fcc.gov/biennial-forms-323-and-323-e-broadcast-ownership-data-and-reports.   We note that a number 
of possible factors could account for shifts or changes in data from 2019 to 2021, including intervening station 
transfers or assignments; other changes in a licensee’s ownership between 2019 and 2021; differences between the 
actual entities that filed reports in the 2019 window versus the 2021 window; diversification of ownership within a 
licensee or respondent that results in fewer findings of a majority control group consisting primarily of one gender, 
racial, or ethnic group; or transfers or assignments of licenses from entities with defined control groups to entities 
with no identifiable control group, among others.

APPENDIX A
Explanatory Notes
Licensing and Management System
The 2021 filing cycle marks the third time Form 323 and 323-E broadcast ownership data were submitted 
via the Commission’s Licensing and Management System (LMS).1  The 2021 biennial ownership data 
analyzed in the report were pulled from LMS on October 7, 2022.  The Media Bureau compiled the 2021 
biennial ownership filings using both algorithmic analysis and manual adjustments to improve the 
accuracy of the reported ownership status and trends.  
The public can search and retrieve ownership reports submitted in LMS based on multiple criteria, 
including call sign, facility ID number, service, station location (city and state), and/or FCC Registration 
Number (FRN), among other things.2  For each report listed, the LMS search results screen indicates 
whether that report was submitted for a licensee/permittee or for a parent entity.  This allows users to 
quickly identify filings that contain relevant information.3  In addition, the data contained in each Form 
323 and 323-E ownership report are publicly available and may be downloaded from the Commission’s 
website then aggregated, cross-referenced, and searched electronically by interested parties.4   
Insufficient and Missing Data 
Insufficient data to identify:  For stations classified as insufficient data, the computer code was unable to 
process the voting interests submitted to the Commission in these stations’ biennial filings.  For the first 
four reports, stations classified as insufficient data for purposes of determining voting interests were also 
classified as insufficient data for counting attributable individuals.  Subsequent reports, including the 
current report, include individuals with attributable interests for all stations that submitted one or more 
323/323-E filings, even if filings for those stations were incomplete.  This approach allows us to include 
attributable interest holders for more stations but, for stations with incomplete filings, the set of 
attributable interest holders reported may be incomplete. 
Not filed:  This category includes situations where (a) the station’s licensee did not file a biennial 323 or 
323-E form, or (b) the Commission’s LMS was unable to accept the licensee’s filing as a result of the 
licensee failing to file a fee , or (c) the licensee’s filing could not be processed at all by the computer code.
Ethnicity and Race Definitions
Ethnicity Definition:
•Hispanic or Latino:  A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or 
other Spanish Culture or origin, regardless of race.5

Manual Adjustments to Data
The computer code was unable to process a number of biennial submissions due to filing errors. 
Commission staff manually examined a number of filings, based on the data contained in the Form 323 
submissions, together with other available information (such as communications with licensees or their 
counsel, as well as analysis of additional reports and applications filed by stations), and reassigned the 
stations to the appropriate category for the purposes of this report.

APPENDIX B
Tables
In this Appendix, we report four tables for each of the ten categories of broadcast stations:  (A) Full 
Power Commercial Television, (B) Class A Television, (C) Low Power Television, (D) Commercial AM 
Radio, (E) Commercial FM Radio, (F) Full Power Noncommercial Television, (G) Class A 
Noncommercial Television, (H) Low Power Noncommercial Television, (I) Noncommercial AM Radio, 
and (J) Noncommercial FM Radio.  
Tables 1 and 2 summarize station ownership by the gender, race, and ethnicity of stations’ attributable 
interest holders.  Tables 3 and 4 report the majority ownership interest of all stations by gender, race, and 
ethnicity.  Each table reports measures nationally and by market size.  The share of stations held by 
individuals in the various classifications reported below are calculated on the basis of the number of 
stations filing usable data, not on the basis of the total number of licensed stations.  Stations that did not 
file an ownership report are classified as “Not Filed” in all tables and are not included in the majority 
ownership interest or the attributable ownership interest calculations.  In addition, some stations 
submitted one or more ownership reports, but their filings were incomplete.  These stations are classified 
as “insufficient data” in Tables 3 and 4, and while these stations are not included in the majority 
ownership interest calculations, attributable interest holders disclosed on reports for these stations are 
included in the attributable ownership interest calculations. 
Table 1 reports the number and share of stations with at least one attributable interest holder who belongs 
to each gender, race, or ethnicity classification.  This table also reports the number and share of stations 
that have at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to a racial and/or ethnic minority group.  
Each station may appear in more than one gender, race, and ethnicity classification in this table.  The 
gender, race, and ethnicity categories are not mutually exclusive in this table.
Table 2 reports the number and share of stations that have at least one attributable interest holder who 
belongs to each race and gender (e.g., Black/African American male, Asian female, etc.) and ethnicity 
and gender (e.g., Hispanic/Latino female, not Hispanic/Latino male, etc.) classification.  The table also 
reports the number and share of stations that have at least one attributable interest holder who belongs to a 
racial and/or ethnic minority group and gender classification (i.e., racial and/or ethnic minority male and 
racial and/or ethnic minority female).  Each station may appear in more than one race and gender, 
ethnicity and gender, and racial/ethnic minority and gender classification in this table.  The race and 
gender, ethnicity and gender, and racial/ethnic minority and gender categories are not mutually exclusive 
in this table.
Tables 1 and 2 report the presence of attributable interest holders in a licensee who belong to different 
gender, race, and ethnicity classifications.  These tables, however, do not offer information on the voting 
interests held by members of each group.  In addition, a station must only have one attributable interest 
holder in a gender, race, or ethnicity classification to be counted in that category.  For instance, a station 
with ten attributable interest holders who are white and one attributable interest holder who is Asian 
would be classified in the same way as a station with ten attributable interest holders who are Asian and 
one attributable interest holder who is white.  Both stations would be classified as having at least one 
attributable interest holder who is Asian and at least one attributable interest holder who is white.
Table 3 reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of the 
same gender, race, or ethnicity hold, either individually or collectively, a majority of the voting interests 
in the licensee; that is, their voting interests exceed 50%.  The table also reports the number and share of 
stations for which members of a racial or ethnic minority group hold a majority of voting interests in the 
licensee.  When a station is identified as having no majority interest, that does not necessarily mean that 
no particular classification of persons has a majority interest in the station, only that this cannot be 
determined from the reported Form 323 or Form 323-E data as submitted.  Each station appears in only 
one gender, race, and ethnicity classification in this table. The gender, race, and ethnicity categories are 
mutually exclusive in this table. 
222                                                      Federal Communications Commission                              DA 23-35
Joint female/male is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners 
and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners both separately exceed 50%.  For example, a 
station where a woman and a man each own 100% of the station as joint tenants would be classified as 
having a joint female/male majority interest in gender.
Table 4 reports the number and share of stations by majority ownership interest in race and gender and 
ethnicity and gender categories.  The table also reports the number and share of stations with a majority 
interest held by a racial and/or ethnic minority group and gender classification (i.e., racial and/or ethnic 
minority male, racial and/or ethnic minority female, racial and/or ethnic minority combination).  Each 
station appears in only one race and gender, ethnicity and gender, and racial/ethnic minority and gender 
classification in this table.  The race and gender, ethnicity and gender, and racial/ethnic minority and 
gender categories are mutually exclusive in this table.
Combination includes situations in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owner(s) and the 
aggregate votes of the male attributable owner(s) of the same race or ethnicity both separately exceed 
50%.  For example, a station in which a woman and man, both Hispanic/Latino, each own 100% as joint 
tenants would be classified as Hispanic/Latino combination.  Combination also includes situations in 
which the aggregate votes of neither gender exceed 50%, but the aggregate votes of the female 
attributable owner(s) and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owner(s) of the same ethnicity or 
race together exceed 50%.  For example, a station in which Asian women hold 40% of the vote and Asian 
men hold 40% of the vote would be classified as Asian combination.  
Some stations that are classified as combination stations are classified as having no majority interest in 
gender in Table 3.  For example, a station in which Hispanic/Latino women hold 45% of the vote, 
Hispanic/Latino men hold 45% of the vote, and 10% of the vote is unattributed would be classified as 
Hispanic/Latino combination and no majority interest in gender.  However, some combination stations 
have a majority interest in gender.  For example, a station in which Hispanic/Latino women hold 45% of 
the vote, Hispanic/Latino men hold 45% of the vote, and not Hispanic/Latino women hold 10% of the 
vote would be classified as Hispanic/Latino combination in Table 4 but female majority interest in gender 
in Table 3.

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of 
the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting 
interests that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and 
Hispanic/Latino men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and 
ethnicity/gender category.

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of 
individuals of the same gender, race, or ethnicity hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  Each station appears in only one gender, race, and ethnicity category.  Joint 
female/male is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners 
and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners both separately exceed 50% (e.g., a station 
where a woman and a man each own 100% of the station as joint tenants).

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of 
the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting 
interests that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and 
Hispanic/Latino men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and 
ethnicity/gender category.

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of 
the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting interests 
that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and Hispanic/Latino 
men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and ethnicity/gender category.

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of 
the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by metro rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting interests 
that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and Hispanic/Latino 
men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and ethnicity/gender category.  
Joint NHPI/White is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander 
attributable owners and the aggregate votes of the white attributable owners both separately exceed 50%.

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of 
the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting interests 
that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and 
Hispanic/Latino men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and 
ethnicity/gender category.

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of 
individuals of the same gender, race, or ethnicity hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  Each station appears in only one gender, race, and ethnicity category.  Joint 
female/male is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners 
and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owners both separately exceed 50% (e.g., a station 
where a woman and a man each own 100% of the station as joint tenants).

Notes:  The table reports the number and share of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of 
the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by DMA rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting interests 
that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and 
Hispanic/Latino men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and 
ethnicity/gender category.

individuals of the same gender, race, or ethnicity hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by metro rank.  Each station appears in only one gender, race, and ethnicity category.  Joint 
female/male is defined as a situation in which the aggregate votes of the female attributable owners

the same race and gender or the same ethnicity and gender hold voting interests that exceed 50%, nationally 
and by metro rank.  A station is classified as a combination if individuals of the same race or ethnicity hold 
voting interests that exceed 50%, but no gender group within the race or ethnicity group holds voting interests 
that exceed 50% (e.g., a station where Hispanic/Latino women hold 30% of voting shares and Hispanic/Latino 
men hold 25% of voting shares).  Each station appears in only one race/gender and ethnicity/gender category.

In re:St. Gabriel Communications
New NCE FM, Spencer, IA
Facility ID No. 767664
Application File No. 0000167515
Informal Objection 
Dear Applicant and Objector:
We have before us the application, as amended, filed by St. Gabriel Communications (SGC) for a 
construction permit for a new noncommercial education (NCE) FM station at Spencer, Iowa.1  We also 
have before us the Informal Objection to the SGC Application, filed by Kevin J. Youngers (Youngers), 
and a related responsive pleading.2  For the reasons set forth below, we deny the Objection, deny the May 
19, 2022, amendment to the SGC Application, and grant the SGC Application as amended by the May 16, 
2022, amendment.
Background.  SGC filed the SGC Application during the 2021 NCE FM Filing Window.3  The 
Media Bureau (Bureau) identified the SGC Application as part of MX Group 78.4  This group consisted 
of four mutually exclusive (MX) applications: the SGC Application, the application of Fairmont Area 
1 Application File No. 0000167515 (SGC Application).  As discussed below, SGC filed two amendments to the 
Application: one on May 16, 2022, and one on May 19, 2022.
2 Pleading File No. 0000193345 (filed June 14, 2022) (Objection). SGC filed an Opposition to the Objection. 
Pleading File No. 0000197019 (filed Aug. 4, 2022) (Opposition).  Youngers did not file a reply to the Opposition.

2021, to November 9, 2021, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 7449 (MB 2021).
4 Media Bureau Identifies Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications Submitted in the November 2021, Filing 
Window for New Noncommercial Education Stations; Opens Window to Accept Settlements and Technical 
Amendments, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 16452 (MB 2021) (MX Groups Public Notice).  
280Catholic Radio,5 the application of VCY American, Inc.,6 and the application of We Have This Hope 
Christian Radio, Inc.7
On April 4, 2022, the Bureau identified the FACR Application as the tentative selectee of MX 
Group 78.8  The Bureau established a 30-day period for filing petitions to deny after which, if there was 
no substantial and material question concerning the grantability of the FACR Application, it would grant 
that application and dismiss the remaining mutually exclusive applications, including the SGC 
Application.9  On May 16, 2022, SGC filed a minor technical amendment to its application to eliminate 
its mutual exclusivity with all other applications in MX Group 78 and render its application a singleton.10  
No party filed a petition to deny the FACR Application, and accordingly, on May 18, 2022, the Bureau 
granted the FACR Application and dismissed the VCY Application and the Hope Application.  On May 
19, 2022, SGC filed another minor technical amendment to its SGC Application, which sought 
authorization to increase the effective radiated power from 6 kW to 22 kW.11  This amendment was only 
possible because the Bureau had dismissed the VCY Application.  
On June 14, 2022, Youngers filed his Objection, claiming that SGC should not have been 
permitted to file its May 16 or May 19 amendments because “[n]o amendments on the original NCE 
applications were allowed after the settlement period which were before the [Fair Distribution Order].”12  
Youngers also argues that the Bureau should not accept amendments after the 30-day petition to deny 
period runs because only one application may be granted from each MX group, and “[i]f applications . . . 
can be amended after the selection process, then there is less pressure to make any settlements in the 
settlement period.”13
In the Opposition, SGC argues that section 73.7003(d) of the Commission’s rules (Rules) permits 
applications to be amended at any time, and that the Commission routinely accepts minor technical 
amendments after the settlement period has run.14
Discussion.  Pursuant to section 309(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act),15 
petitions to deny and informal objections must provide properly supported allegations of fact that, if true,

281would establish a substantial and material question of fact that grant of the application would be prima 
facie inconsistent with the public interest.16  
We reject Younger’s suggestion that the May 16 amendment to the SGC application was 
prohibited, and that the application grant would violate the one-grant policy.  Under the one-grant policy, 
the Commission only grants one application (or tied applications) per mutually exclusive group.17  In our 
most recent review of our NCE processing rules, the Commission explicitly upheld the one-grant policy 
and rejected requests to allow for secondary grants after selection of a tentative selectee.18  However, 
nothing in the Rules, the MX Groups Public Notice, nor our NCE FM processing procedures19 prohibits 
an applicant from filing an amendment to eliminate its mutual exclusivities before, or after, the Bureau or 
the Commission conducts its comparative analysis.  Specifically, the Commission held that it would 
“continue to permit additional grants from an MX group if an applicant—by technical amendment, the 
voluntary dismissal of competing applications, and/or a valid settlement agreement—eliminates all 
conflicts to other applications in the group.”20  Here, SGC’s May 16 amendment fully resolved all of its 
mutually exclusivities with all of the other applicants in MX Group 78 and thus completely removed the 
application from MX Group 78.  This amendment was not dependent on the Commission dismissing 
applications from the MX group and, therefore, does not violate our one-grant policy.  
In contrast, SGC’s subsequent May 19 technical amendment to its engineering proposal violates 
our one-grant policy.21  Unlike the May 16 amendment, SGC’s May 19 amendment is dependent on the 
Commission involuntarily dismissing the VCY Application, which is the type of secondary grant the 
Commission previously rejected.22  The Commission has affirmed the dismissal of applications that 
became singletons based solely on the involuntary dismissal of other conflicting applications in the MX 
group.23.  We have also recently rejected similar efforts by applicants that rely on the involuntary

settlements, not to unilateral amendments.  See 47 CFR § 73.7003(d).

WIRELINE COMPETITION BUREAU APPROVES FURTHER REVISED ALASKA 
PLAN PERFORMANCE PLAN FOR ARCTIC SLOPE TELEPHONE COOPERATIVE
WC Docket No. 10-90
WC Docket No. 16-271
In this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) approves a revised performance 
plan for rate-of-return Alaska Plan participant Arctic Slope Telephone Cooperative (ASTAC) (SAC 
613001). 
In the Alaska Plan Order, the Commission provided a one-time opportunity for Alaskan rate-of-
return carriers to elect to receive support frozen at adjusted 2011 levels for a 10-year term in exchange for 
meeting individualized performance obligations—offering voice and broadband services at specified 
minimum speeds by five-year and 10-year service milestones to a specified number of locations.1  On 
December 16, 2016, the Bureau authorized the individualized performance obligations and support 
amounts for 13 rate-of-return companies in Alaska.2  The Commission directed the Bureau “to reassess 
the deployment obligations in the approved performance plans before the end of the fifth year of support,” 
that is, 2021, and required that “participating carriers update their end-of-term commitments no later than 
the end of the fourth year of support.”3  The Commission further delegated to the Bureau the “authority to 
review and approve modifications that serve the public interest,”4 including deployment obligations if 
changes are necessary based on changed circumstances.5  
On December 23, 2021, the Bureau announced the performance obligations for rate-of-return 
Alaska Plan carriers as part of the five-year midterm review.6  As part of its mid-term review, the Bureau 
approved revised performance obligations for ASTAC,7 which ASTAC certified to meeting.  On

November 18, 2022, ASTAC submitted updated wireline performance obligations,8 and supplemented 
those on December 19, 2022.9  ASTAC states that it was able to (1) negotiate access to fiber middle mile 
capacity at a lower rate, allowing ASTAC to offer service at higher speeds, i.e., at least 100/20 Mbps, in 
many areas, and (2) move service in Atqasuk from satellite to fiber middle mile resulting in an additional 
78 newly deployed/upgraded locations by the end of the 10-year term.10 
We find it is in the public interest to approve ASTAC’s revised performance obligations, which 
are in Appendix A to this Public Notice.  Appendix B to this Public Notice provides the minimum number 
of locations to be reported in the High-Cost Universal Broadband portal, or HUBB, i.e., newly deployed 
and upgraded locations over the term of the Alaska Plan, by speed and middle-mile, at the five-year and 
10-year service milestones.  The performance obligations we approve today replace the performance 
obligations the Bureau approved for ASTAC on December 23, 2021.11

DOMESTIC SECTION 214 APPLICATION GRANTED 
FOR THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF IDEATEK TELCOM, LLC 
WC Docket No. 22-391
By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) grants an application filed by 
Daniel P. Friesen and IdeaTek Telcom, LLC (IdeaTek) (collectively, Applicants), pursuant to section 214 
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and sections 63.03-04 of the Commission’s rules,1 
requesting consent to transfer control of IdeaTek.2 
On December 9, 2022, the Bureau released a Public Notice seeking comment on the Application.3  
The Bureau did not receive comments or petitions in opposition to the Application. 
Applicants and Description of Transaction
IdeaTek, a Kansas limited liability company, provides competitive voice and broadband services 
and is a competitive local exchange carrier serving approximately 15,000 subscribers in Kansas.4  
IdeaTek is an Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (ETC) and receives Connect America Fund (CAF) 
Phase II Auction 903 support in Kansas.5  On March 15, 2022, the Bureau also authorized IdeaTek to 
receive $23,590.60 in Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) Auction 904 support to provide service to 
1 See 47 U.S.C. § 214; 47 CFR §§ 63.03-04.

5 Id.  IdeaTek was the winning bidder for $6,186,881.60 of CAF Phase II Auction 903 support to serve 2,490 
locations in Kansas.  See Connect America Fund Phase II Auction Support Authorized for 856 Winning Bids, WC 
Docket No. 10-90, AU Docket No. 17-182, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 4725, Attach. A (Authorized Long-Form 
Applicants and Winning Bids) (WCB 2019) (CAF Phase II Public Notice).  
291an estimated 89 locations in Kansas.6  Daniel Friesen, a U.S. citizen, currently owns 53.21% of IdeaTek 
and is the sole manager, and Jerrod Reimer, a U.S. citizen, owns 13.54% of the company.7  
Applicants state that “Pursuant to the terms of a Convertible Secured Promissory Note 
(‘Convertible Note’) and a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (‘Purchase Agreement’), Peppertree 
Capital Fund IX, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, Peppertree Capital Fund IX QP, LP, a Delaware 
limited partnership, and Peppertree Capital FIX Co-Investors, LLC, (collectively, the ‘Peppertree Funds’), 
an Ohio limited liability company, made a significant debt investment in IdeaTek and acquired the right 
to convert its debt into ownership of up to a total of 49.5% in IdeaTek, subject to the prior consent of the 
Commission to a transfer of control of IdeaTek’s domestic section 214 authorization and wireless 
licenses.”8  Following consummation of the proposed transaction, Peppertree Capital Fund IX QP, LP 
would own approximately 47.3% of IdeaTek, and the two other funds each would own approximately 
1%.9  The Peppertree Funds are managed by Peppertree Capital Management, Inc. (PCMI), an Ohio 
private equity firm controlled by United States citizens.10  Upon consummation of the proposed 
transaction, the Convertible Note will convert to equity in IdeaTek, and Daniel P. Friesen’s interest will 
be reduced from 53.21% to 24.46%, thereby effectuating a transfer of control of IdeaTek.11  Applicants 
state that the PCMI entities and their affiliates do not provide any telecommunications services.12
Applicants assert that a grant of the Application would serve the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity, and that PCMI’s capital investment will enhance IdeaTek’s ability to meet and accelerate 
service obligations for its CAF and RDOF locations under the company’s existing management.13  
Discussion
We find, upon consideration of the record, that a grant of the Application will serve the public 
interest, convenience, and necessity.  To make this determination under Commission precedent, we 
consider whether the proposed transaction could result in public interest harms by substantially frustrating 
or impairing the objectives or implementation of the Act or related statutes.14  We then employ a

potential public interest benefits.15  The Applicants bear the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that the proposed transaction, on balance, serves the public interest.16
We find that the record contains no evidence of any potential public interest harms.  First, the 
proposed transaction will not result in a reduction of competition.  The PCMI entities are not affiliated 
with any domestic telecommunications carriers,17 and there will thus be no physical overlap or reduction 
in service providers in any markets as a result of the transaction.  Further, Applicants state that the 
transaction will “not impact IdeaTek’s customers” and will have “no adverse –or, indeed, any— impact 
on customers and will not alter the planned manner of service delivery or billing.”18  Applicants state 
further that no changes are planned to IdeaTek’s rates, terms, and conditions of services,19 and we thus 
expect no potential harm to existing customers to result from the transaction.
Second, IdeaTek will remain financially, managerially, and technically obligated to meet all 
public interest and performance obligations associated with the receipt of CAF Phase II and RDOF 
funding in accordance with the Commission’s pre-transaction approval of its qualifications, and we 
expect that the proposed transaction will not negatively impact these obligations.20  Applicants have 
confirmed that the proposed transaction will not affect IdeaTek’s deployment plans.21  Specifically, 
Applicants state: “The debt conversion will not adversely impact IdeaTek’s ability to meet its CAF or 
RDOF commitments and, in fact, provides additional liquidity to accelerate buildout and growth and 
facilitate additional investment should it be necessary.  The funds loaned to IdeaTek under the 
Convertible Note enabled IdeaTek to retire approximately 30% of its existing bank debt, and the 
conversion of the loan to equity will enhance IdeaTek’s access to other sources of capital.”22  Applicants 
have also confirmed that “there will be no changes in the management of IdeaTek or the technology used 
by IdeaTek to provide service as a result of the proposed Transaction.”23  Overall, we conclude that the 
record in this proceeding does not support a finding of a public interest harm.

293specific public interest benefits.24  Applicants must provide evidence of a claimed benefit to allow the 
Commission to verify its likelihood and magnitude.25  Where potential harms appear unlikely, as is the 
case with the Application before us here, the Commission accepts a lesser degree of magnitude and 
likelihood than when harms are present.26  
Applicants assert that the proposed transaction will “provide significant additional capital for 
IdeaTek to continue its ongoing expansion of Gigabit broadband services in Kansas” and, with regard to 
the RDOF program, will provide funding that “far exceeds the amount of money IdeaTek will need to 
complete its CAF and RDOF deployment obligations.”27  Applicants state that “the Peppertree Funds’ 
capital infusion is helping, and will continue to help, accelerate the planned deployment and customer 
benefits.”28  Applicants further state: “IdeaTek has completed its CAF network deployment to more than 
76% of the required locations – well in excess of the 40% required by the end of 2022 – and has reduced 
the amount of its CAF letter of credit by 50%.  In addition, IdeaTek has timely submitted required speed 
and latency pre-testing and testing results to USAC.”29  Applicants state that the proposed transaction will 
further IdeaTek’s progress moving forward and “enhance IdeaTek’s ability to perform its CAF and RDOF 
obligations and achieve its growth objectives.”30 
The Commission has specified that ensuring consumers receive new or additional services is an 
important public interest factor,31 and accelerating private sector deployment of advanced services is one 
of the aims of the Act.32  In light of the Applicants’ commitments to meet all of Licensees’ federal high 
cost funding obligations33 and the fact that Applicants are prepared to devote additional capital to 
accelerate facilities-based service offerings,34 we find it likely that the proposed transaction would result 
in some public interest benefits.  Absent any potential harms, and considering that the proposed 
transaction is likely to yield some benefits, we find, on balance, that the proposed transaction serves the 
public interest.
Therefore, pursuant to section 214 of the Act, 47 U.S.C. § 214, and sections 0.91, 0.291, 63.03,

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Adopted:  January 19, 2023 Released:  January 19, 2023
By the Associate Chief, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. Section 17.47(b) of the Commission’s rules requires antenna structure owners to conduct 
quarterly inspections of certain lighting systems;1 section 17.47(c) exempts from that requirement systems 
that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) has found to include self-diagnostic features 
sufficient to make the quarterly inspections unnecessary.2  In this Memorandum Opinion and Order, we 
determine that the American Electric Power Service Corporation Monitoring System (AEPMS) satisfies 
the criteria of section 17.47(c) and that American Electric Power Service Corporation’s (AEP) antenna 
structures using that system are therefore exempt from the quarterly inspection requirement.3  Our action 
today should encourage other tower owners to invest in state-of-the-art technologies so that they, too, will 
become capable of continuous monitoring of both their lighting systems and control devices. 
II. BACKGROUND
2. Section 17.47(b) provides that the owner of any antenna structure that is registered with 
the Commission and that has been assigned lighting specifications pursuant to part 17 “[s]hall inspect at 
1 47 CFR § 17.47(b). 
2 47 CFR § 17.47(c). 
3 In the matter of American Electric Power Service Corporation Request for Waiver of 47 C.F.R. § 17.47(b), 
Request for Waiver, filed January 10, 2022 (AEP Request).  On May 12, 2022, the Bureau’s Competition and 
Infrastructure Policy Division (CIPD) requested additional information.  See Letter from Jill A. Springer, Associate 
Chief, Competition and Infrastructure Policy Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, to Bradford N. Holt, 
Director, Telecom Engineering Projects, American Electric Power Service Corporation (May 12, 2022).  On May 
31, 2022, AEP supplemented its waiver request with information regarding the technical characteristics and 
operational capabilities of the AEPMS.  See Email from Bradford N. Holt, Director, Telecom Engineering Projects, 
American Electric Power Service Corporation, to Michael C. Smith, Program Analyst, Competition and 
Infrastructure Policy Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (May 31, 2022) (AEP Supplement).  On 
December 1, 2022, CIPD sent a second request for additional information.  See Email from Michael C. Smith, 
Program Analyst, Competition and Infrastructure Policy Division, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, to

intervals not to exceed 3 months all automatic or mechanical control devices, indicators, and alarm 
systems associated with the antenna structure lighting to insure that such apparatus is functioning 
properly.”4  Section 17.47(c) exempts from this requirement “any antenna structure monitored by a 
system that the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has determined includes self-diagnostic features 
sufficient to render quarterly inspections unnecessary, upon certification of use of such system to the 
Bureau.”5
3. AEP provides monitoring for its affiliates and subsidiaries, currently in 375 sites across 
the United States, which are subject to the Commission’s lighting requirements in part 17.6  AEP filed a 
petition with the Bureau asking us to determine that the self-diagnostic functions of the AEPMS are 
sufficiently robust to ensure that the control devices, indicators, and alarm systems on antenna structures 
using the AEPMS are operating properly, such that quarterly inspections are unnecessary.7  AEP argues 
that the quarterly inspections of antenna monitoring systems mandated by section 17.47(b) have been 
rendered unnecessary because of technological advancements associated with the AEPMS.  AEP asks us 
to “modify the Quarterly Inspection requirement to provide that such inspections be made annually with 
regard to all AEP’s monitored towers”8 pursuant to section 17.47(c).9  
4. Specifically, AEP asserts in its petition that the AEPMS is similar to systems that have 
previously supported waiver grants10 and is a sophisticated, proven technology that is highly accurate and 
reliable.11  AEP asserts that its system employs self-diagnostic functions that are sufficiently robust so as 
to make unnecessary quarterly inspections to ensure that the control devices, indicators, and alarm 
systems on the towers are operating properly.12  AEP maintains that the AEPMS provides the functional 
equivalent of a continuous inspection of control devices on all towers it monitors.  As a result, AEP states 
that “users of the AEP System, like users of the Eagle and Hark Systems,” systems for which the 
Commission previously approved waivers of section 17.47(b), “are alerted to actual and potential 
problems immediately in many cases and at most within twenty-four hours.”13  In support of these 
contentions, AEP describes the alarm notification, 24-hour polling, manual contact, and staffing and fail-
safe procedures of the systems as set forth below.

9 Before creating the procedure for exemptions in section 17.47(c), the Commission granted limited waivers of 
section 17.47(b) and permitted antenna structure owners to conduct annual, rather than quarterly, inspections.  After 
2014, section 17.47(c) rendered such waivers unnecessary.  See 2004 and 2006 Biennial Regulatory Reviews – 
Streamlining and Other Revisions of Parts 1 and 17 of the Commission’s Rules Governing Construction, Marking 
and Lighting of Antenna Structures; Amendments to Modernize and Clarify Part 17 of the Commission’s Rules 
Concerning Construction, Marking and Lighting of Antenna Structures, Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd 9787, 9799-
9802 (2014) (Part 17 Order).  Accordingly, we treat AEP’s waiver request as a petition for relief of quarterly or 
annual inspection obligations pursuant to section 17.47(c) on our own motion.

Eagle and Hark Systems).
297Federal Communications Commission DA 23-43
5.Alarm notification.  At each AEPMS monitored tower, the tower site receives “alarms 
from the light controller, which contacts the AEP Network Operations Center (NOC) for every type of 
alarm condition.”14  The AEPMS classifies alarms as either critical or minor, with beacon/strobe/flashing 
sidelight failure, beacon/strobe communication failure, photo cell failure, site communication failure, 
power failure, GPS Sync failure, filter failure, low flash energy, and consecutive missed flashes treated as 
critical15, and side and single marker failure classified as minor.16  These alarms are captured and archived 
within the AEPMS database, which has an automated escalation protocol.  If, after 30 minutes, the 
problem is not corrected and the alarm requires a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) 17 to be filed, AEP NOC 
personnel issue and record a manual NOTAM.18  In the event of a NOTAM-worthy event, NOC 
personnel create a field service ticket for a site equipment inspection, with such inspections to be 
completed within 7 days.19  Personnel can also log into the system database and check the site anytime to 
perform additional diagnostics and troubleshooting and can attempt to correct the problem remotely.20  
6.24-hour polling.  The AEP System is programmed to proactively initiate a connection 
from each monitored site at least once every hour or 24 times per every 24 hours.21  In the event 
communications are lost, the system generates an alarm requiring a NOC Technician to attempt to contact 
the site manually.  If the NOC Technician is unable to connect to the tower, a NOTAM is issued and 
alerts are sent to the designated responsible site contacts for follow up.  If alarms are cleared 
automatically then updates are recorded in the system database.22  Once the issue is corrected and site 
correct operation verified, the NOTAM is canceled and recorded in an electronic database and stored for 
5 years.23 
7.Manual contact.  The AEPMS allows NOC technicians to perform a “manual diagnostic 
review of any tower monitored by the system from any computer connected to the internet and a secure 
connection to AEP’s network.”24  That function enables personnel to contact the AEPMS “at the tower 
and review the operational status of the tower's lighting system at any time.”25  As a result, NOC 
personnel can remotely perform diagnostics and troubleshoot a problem, potentially correcting it 
remotely.26

8.Staffing and Fail-Safe Procedures.  According to AEP, the AEPMS receives and reports 
alarms that are activated when the self-diagnostic functions of the obstruction lighting systems determine 
that there is a lighting malfunction.  These monitoring devices are microcomputer-based and include 
programmable delays to prevent false alarms, alphanumeric labeling for input and output circuits to 
remove confusion as to the origin of alarms, and the capability of handling a variety of two-way 
communications to the NOC.  The AEPMS allows NOC personnel to remotely perform inspections on the 
fly to ensure normal operation.27  In addition, AEP monitors server health at both the physical and 
operating system levels, including monitoring software (that is external to the server) to ensure that the 
server components of the system are running properly.28
9. To monitor the alarms, AEP’s NOC and backup NOC are staffed with trained personnel 
capable of responding to alarms 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, which allows personnel to “easily 
shift to either location quickly in the event that one site is compromised.”29  The NOC is located at AEP’s 
primary facility in Gahanna, OH, which includes a backup diesel generator that helps prevent power 
failure at the facility.30  AEP’s NOC personnel can also access the system from any computer in the 
world.31  In the event of a catastrophe, AEP has a backup NOC in Groveport, OH32 and has prepared a 
detailed disaster recovery procedures plan that would be placed into effect.33  Since the primary and 
secondary locations are manned, personnel can easily shift to either location quickly in the event that one 
site is compromised.34  The existence of two NOC centers is an important fail-safe mechanism, as it 
allows the backup center to assume monitoring responsibilities in the event of a catastrophic failure at the 
primary center.35  
10. In the event that both NOCs were to become incapacitated and suffer complete failures, 
AEP NOC technicians can connect from any physical location using a secure internet connection to the 
Telenium alarm servers.36  In addition, ten off-site NOC contractors have remote Telenium alarm server 
access for uninterrupted alarm monitoring.37  The transfer of monitoring would be immediate since off-
site users are able to access the Telenium servers from any remote location through AEP’s VPN network, 
which includes redundancies via New Albany, OH and Tulsa, OK.38  These fail-safe procedures ensure 
that robust monitoring of the towers will continue even if one or both of the NOC centers is rendered 
inoperable. 
11. Further, there is battery backup at both the sites and the NOC, as well as redundant 
communications systems within the AEP System.39  Battery backup for the vast majority of the sites have 
both local generators and battery systems that ensure power for several days, while some of the sites have

solar power systems with seven days of autonomy.40  AEP states that 8% of the current AEPMS sites are 
designed with battery backup able to maintain communications links to the alarm system for only 2-3 
hours;41 however, AEP states that these sites are located within urban areas where field techs are quickly 
available, 24/7/365, to resolve the issue well within the 2–3 hour battery backup window,42 and that 
“power to these locations is often restored automatically by distribution switching or as part of the 
utility’s power restoration plan.”43  Communications of events to the AEP NOC are provided using digital 
cellular communications with 99.5% availability, and/or AEP’s internal network, designed with 99.999% 
availability.44  The AEP System includes redundant systems using ring architecture, which, upon failure 
of a single transport node and/or cellular gateway, immediately switches to a backup to restore 
connectivity to the light controller.  In the event that the light controller loses communications to the 
alarm server, the AEP System has redundant cellular gateways through the two Telenium alarm servers.  
The built-in redundancies ensure that the AEP System’s notifications are sent immediately in the event of 
an alarm.45  
III. DISCUSSION
12. We find that the AEPMS “includes self-diagnostic features sufficient to render quarterly 
inspections unnecessary”46 and is similar to the monitoring systems we have evaluated in other orders.  
On May 15, 2007, the Commission granted American Tower Corporation (ATC) and Global Signal, Inc. 
(GSI) waivers of section 17.47(b) to allow annual, rather than quarterly, inspection of towers monitored 
by specified, technologically advanced monitoring systems.47  In the 2014 Part 17 Order, the 
Commission granted exemptions from all inspection obligations to those entities previously granted a 
waiver for their antenna structures monitored by qualifying systems, as long as they continued to meet the 
advanced monitoring obligations to which they had already certified.48  Since then, the Bureau has, on 
delegated authority, granted similar waivers to entities demonstrating that their systems were similarly 
robust, and were operated in a similar manner, to the systems described in the ATC and Global Tower 
Waiver Order.49  Accordingly, we find that the AEPMS, when used in the manner described by AEP, 
justifies an exemption from the quarterly inspection requirement of section 17.47(b) pursuant to section 
17.47(c).
13. The technology that the AEPMS employs is similar to that exhibited by other monitoring 
systems that we have previously found to be sufficiently robust to support waivers based on the efficacy 
of their system and backup procedures.  The AEPMS is similar in that it has a continuous and permanent

two-way link between the tower site and the response center;50 timely reporting of potential problems;51 
continuously staffed response centers;52 24-hour polling of both lighting and communications systems;53 
on demand interrogation capabilities;54 backup response centers;55 and essentially uninterrupted 
communications between the response center and the towers during power outages.56 
14. Based on the record before us, and consistent with previous Commission and Bureau 
orders, the Bureau finds that the AEPMS includes self-diagnostic features sufficient to render quarterly 
inspections unnecessary.57  We conclude that the AEPMS is a safe and reliable monitoring system with 
tracking mechanisms that ensure proper functioning of their remote monitoring technology.  Such 
advanced technology provides the benefits of more rapid response in case of a lighting failure.  As a 
result, the AEPMS, when used in the manner described by AEP, justifies an exemption from the quarterly 
inspection requirement of section 17.47(b).  Therefore, pursuant to section 17.47(c), AEP is exempt from 
section 17.47(b) with regard to any of its towers monitored by the AEPMS in the manner described in this 
Order.  This will enable AEP to more efficiently carry out its responsibilities under part 17 of the 
Commission’s rules.58  Our actions today should encourage other tower owners to invest in state-of-the-
art technologies so that they, too, will become capable of continuous monitoring of both their lighting 
systems and control devices.

OFFICE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY SEEKS COMMENT ON BLUEWIND 
MEDICAL LTD.  REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF SECTION 15.223(A) OF THE COMMISSION’S 
RULES FOR OPERATION ON 6.78 MHZ
ET Docket No. 23-27
Comment Date: February 21, 2023 
Reply Comment Date: March 8, 2023
By this public notice, we seek comment on a request by Bluewind Medical Ltd. (BlueWind 
Medical) to waive Section 15.223(a) of the Commission’s rules to permit its implantable medical device 
system (the “BlueWind System”) operating on the center frequency 6.78 MHz to exceed the 1.705-10 
MHz band emission limits.1    
BlueWind Medical states its tibial neuromodulation system is intended to be used to treat patients 
diagnosed with overactive bladder (OAB) and related symptoms.2  BlueWind Medical's system is 
comprised of four units: an implant, the rechargeable External Control Unit (ECU), a software 
application, and a Hub unit.3  The implant uses electrical pulses to stimulate nerves innervating the 
bladder, urinary sphincter, and pelvic floor.4  The implant receives power and data from the ECU through 
near-field inductive coupling via pulse modulation of a 6.78 MHz carrier signal, at rate of up to 30 Hz.5  
BlueWind Medical claims its system will provide substantial health benefits to millions of people and 
pose no threat of harmful interference.6  
Section 15.223(a) of the Commission’s rules limits the field strength of any emission in the 
1.705-10 MHz frequency range to 100 microvolts per meter at a distance of 30 meters.7  The rule further 
stipulates that if the bandwidth of the emission is less than 10% of the center frequency, then the field 
strength measured at 30 meters shall not exceed 15 microvolts per meter or (bandwidth of the device in 
kHz) / (center frequency of device in MHz) microvolts per meter, whichever value is higher.8  BlueWind

302indicates that the applicable emission limit under the rule would be 15 microvolts per meter at 30 meters.9  
BlueWind Medical states that the ECU produces a maximum average field strength of 77 microvolts per 
meter.10  However, to account for production tolerances, standard measurement uncertainty and potential 
adjustments for future generation designs, BlueWind Medical is seeking a waiver to permit its system to 
be certified and marketed with ECU emissions to not exceed a 108.8 microvolts per meter field strength.11
We seek comment on BlueWind Medical’s Waiver Request.  To develop a complete record on 
the issues presented by this request, this proceeding will be treated, for ex parte purposes, as "permit-but-

Lingo Telecom, LLC
Complaint Regarding 
Unauthorized Change of

                 Complaint No. 5908094
ORDER
Adopted:  January 18, 2023 Released:  January 18, 2023
By the Acting Chief, Consumer Policy Division, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau:
1. In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Lingo Telecom, LLC (Lingo) 
changed Complainant’s telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and 
verification from Complainant as required by the Commission’s rules.1  We conclude that Lingo’s actions 
violated the Commission’s slamming rules, and we therefore grant Complainant’s complaint.
2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), prohibits the 
practice of “slamming,” the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscriber’s selection 
of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2  The Commission’s implementing 
rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier 
change may occur.3  Specifically, a carrier must: (1) obtain the subscriber’s written or electronically 
signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules; (2) obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a 
toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically; or (3) utilize an 
appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4  The Commission has also adopted 
rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require 
carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without 
authorization.5  
3. The Commission’s slamming rules prohibit misrepresentations on sales calls to further 
reduce the incidence of slamming.6  Under the rules, upon a finding of material misrepresentation during

2 47 U.S.C. § 258(a).
3 See 47 CFR § 64.1120.
4 See id. § 64.1120(c).  Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or 
electronically signed authorizations.  Id. § 64.1130.
5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her 
bill.  If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability 
for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized 
change.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1160.  Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service 
provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber 
was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change.  Id.  Where the subscriber has paid 
charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commission’s rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of 
those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent 
of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1170.

the sales call, the consumer’s authorization to change carriers will be deemed invalid even if the carrier 
has some evidence of consumer authorization of a carrier switch, e.g., a third-party verification (TPV) 
recording.  Sales misrepresentations may not be cured by a facially valid TPV.7  The rule provides that a 
consumer’s credible allegation of misrepresentation shifts the burden of proof to the carrier to provide 
evidence to rebut the consumer’s claim regarding misrepresentation.  The Commission made clear that an 
accurate and complete recording of the sales call may be the carrier’s best persuasive evidence to rebut 
the consumer’s claim that a misrepresentation was made on the sales call.8
4. We received Complainant’s complaint alleging that Complainant’s telecommunications 
service provider had been changed without Complainant’s authorization.9  In the complaint, Complainant 
also alleged that she received a call from someone who claimed to be with AT&T, her company’s existing 
carrier.10  
5. Pursuant to our rules, we notified Lingo of the complaint, directing Lingo to address the 
specific misrepresentation allegation and to provide any evidence to rebut it.11  With its response, Lingo 
provided an audio recording that it characterized as a “Quality Control Call,” along with a contract Lingo 
said Complainant signed.12  Lingo did not, however, address Complainant’s misrepresentation allegation 
and did not provide a recording of the sales call or any other evidence related to the sales call.13  
6. Based on the evidence in the record, we find Complainant’s allegation of a sales call 
misrepresentation to be credible.  We further find that Lingo has failed to provide persuasive evidence to 
rebut Complainant’s misrepresentation claim and therefore that Complainant’s authorization to change 
carriers is invalid.14  As the Commission stated in the 2018 Slamming Order, “[w]hen a consumer’s 
decision to switch carriers is predicated on false information provided in a sales call, that consumer’s 
authorization to switch carriers can no longer be considered binding.”15  We therefore find that Lingo’s 
actions resulted in an unauthorized change in Complainant’s telecommunications service provider, as 
defined by the rules, and we discuss Lingo’s liability below.16

5773, 5778-80, paras. 17-19 (2018) (2018 Slamming Order); 47 CFR § 64.1120(a)(1)(i)(A).  
8 See 2018 Slamming Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 5781, para. 23.  The Commission also stated that a carrier is uniquely 
positioned via its access to sales scripts, recordings, training, and other relevant materials relating to sales calls to 
proffer evidence to rebut a consumer’s claims.  Id.

13 Lingo simply stated that Complainant “would have been advised that the Company utilizes AT&T as the 
underlying provider, but that Lingo would be the carrier and would be invoicing for the services, as well as handling 
all customer service questions or concerns.”  See Lingo Response at 1. 
14 We also note that on the “Quality Control Call” Lingo submitted, the Lingo representative informs the consumer 
that “AT&T will continue to operate [Complainant’s telephone lines].”

TPV calls did not cure those misrepresentations)).  
16 If Complainant is unsatisfied with the resolution of the complaint, the Complainant may file a formal complaint

7. Lingo must remove all charges incurred for service provided to Complainant for the first 
thirty days after the alleged unauthorized change in accordance with the Commission’s liability rules.17  
We have determined that Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first 
thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that neither the Complainant’s authorized carrier 
nor Lingo may pursue any collection against Complainant for those charges.18  Any charges imposed by 
Lingo on the Complainant for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the Complainant 
to the authorized carrier at the rates the Complainant was paying the authorized carrier at the time of the 
unauthorized change of their telecommunications service provider.19

of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 258, and sections 0.141, 0.361, and 1.719 of the Commission’s rules, 
47 CFR §§ 0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Lingo Telecom, LLC IS GRANTED.
9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to section 64.1170(d) of the Commission’s 
rules, 47 CFR § 64.1170(d), Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first 
thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that Lingo Telecom, LLC may not pursue any

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER AND
NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE
Adopted:  January 19, 2023 Released:  January 19, 2023
By the Chief, Video Division, Media Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Media Bureau (Bureau) has before it G.I.G., Inc. (G.I.G.), licensee of low power 
television (LPTV) station KCPO-LP, Sioux Falls, South Dakota (KCPO-LP or Station).  In this 
Memorandum Opinion and Order and Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture (NAL),1 we find that 
G.I.G. apparently willfully violated section 74.7882 of the Rules by failing to timely file a license to cover 
application for the Station, and willfully and repeatedly violated section 73.1745 of the Rules and 301 of 
the Act,3 by engaging in unauthorized operation.  Based upon our review of the facts and circumstances 
before us, we conclude that G.I.G. is apparently liable for a monetary forfeiture in the amount of six 
thousand, five hundred dollars ($6,500).  Upon resolution of the forfeiture proceeding commenced herein 
and so long as there are no other issues that would preclude such action, we will grant G.I.G.’s pending 
application to renew the Station’s license for a period of two years.4
1 This NAL is issued pursuant to sections 309(k) and 503(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), 
and section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules (Rules).  See 47 U.S.C. §§ 309(k), 503(b); 47 CFR § 1.80.  The Bureau 
has delegated authority to issue the NAL under section 0.283 of the Rules.  See 47 CFR § 0.283.
2 See 47 CFR § 74.788 (2022).  Effective October 24, 2022, 47 CFR § 74.788 of the Commission’s rules was 
eliminated and found by the commission to be duplicative with 47 CFR § 73.3598 of the Rules. See 87 FR 58200, 
Oct. 24, 2022; In the Matter of Amend. of Parts 73 and 74 of the Commission's Rules to Establish Rules for Digital 
Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations, Update of Parts 74 of the Commission’s Rules Related to

(making 47 CFR § 73.3598 applicable to all TV translator and LPTV stations).  At the time the violation at issue 
occurred, 47 CFR § 74.788 was in effect; however, to the extent necessary we also find that the Licensee violated 47 
CFR § 73.3598.

II. BACKGROUND
2. KCPO-LP was a former analog low power television (LPTV) station.  The Station, like 
all other analog stations, was required to cease analog operations by 11:59 p.m. on July 13, 2021.5  On 
March 31, 2020, the Station filed a construction permit to flash-cut its analog operations to digital 
operations on its licensed analog channel 26 (Digital CP).6  That application was granted on April 20, 
2020.  Pursuant to Commission rules, the Station was assigned a construction permit expiration date of 
July 13, 2021.7  On April 28, 2021, the Station was granted an extension of its construction permit to 
January 10, 2022 (CP Extension).8  In the CP Extension, G.I.G. represented that construction of the 
Station had not been completed and laid out a timeline for completing construction.  No subsequent 
request for tolling was filed.  
3. As discussed in further detail below, the Licensee has stated that it commenced digital 
operations pursuant to the Digital CP on April 21, 2020.  On July 29, 2022, G.I.G. filed a request for 
silent authority notifying the commission that the Station went silent on July 27, 2022 due to the loss its 
“site.”9  In addition, the Licensee filed a request for special temporary authority to commence operations 
from a new location while it finalizes a construction permit to move to the proposed site on a permanent 
basis.10  Both the Silent STA and Engineering STA applications remain pending.   
4. Section 74.788(b) of the Commission’s rules stated that:  “Any construction permit for 
which construction has not been completed and for which an application for license or extension of time 
has not been filed, shall be automatically forfeited upon expiration without any further affirmative 
cancellation by the Commission.”11  Although G.I.G. has maintained that it completed construction and 
began operating its digital facility on April 21, 2020,12 it failed to file a timely application for license to 
cover after completing construction.  As such, the Digital CP automatically expired on its own terms on 
January 11, 2021. 
5. On December 1, 2021, G.I.G. filed an application for license renewal (Renewal 
Application).  In that application G.I.G. certified that the Station was operational.  As part of Video 
5 See 47 CFR § 74.788(a) (2022); Amendment of Parts 73 and 74 of the Commission’s Rules to Establish Rules for 
Digital Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations, MB Docket No. 03-185, Third Report and Order 
and Fourth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 30 FCC Rcd 14927, 14932-33, para. 9 (2015).  In that decision, the 
Commission extended the LPTV digital transition date and all valid digital construction permit expiration dates for 
analog stations until 12 months following the completion of the 39-month post-Incentive Auction transition period, 
or 51 months from the completion of the Incentive Auction and the release of the Closing and Channel 
Reassignment Public Notice.  Id.  See Incentive Auction Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice: The 
Broadcast Television Incentive Auction Closes; Reverse Auction and Forward Auction Results Announced; Final 
Television Band Channel Assignments Announced; Post-Auction Deadlines Announced, Public Notice, 32 FCC Rcd 
2786 (IATF and MB 2018) (Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice).  Given the April 13, 2017 release 
date of the Closing and Channel Reassignment Public Notice, the LPTV digital transition date and expiration date of 
all analog stations’ digital construction permits were set as July 13, 2021.  47 CFR § 74.731.  See e.g., Media 
Bureau Reminds Low Power Television and Television Translator Stations of July 13, 2021, Digital Transition

Division staff review of the Renewal Application it was discovered that G.I.G. had failed to file an 
application for license to cover (License Application) its Digital CP.  As a result, on May 20, 2022, the 
Division sent G.I.G a letter inquiring as to the Station’s operational history.13   On July 5 and 11, 2022 the 
Licensee filed two separate responses to the Division’s inquiry letter asserting that G.I.G. in fact 
completed construction of its digital facility in April 2020 (July Responses).14  In addition, on July 11, 
2022, the Licensee filed a License Application and requested waiver of all applicable rules and grant of 
the application.15  Following a series of phone calls in August 2022 between Division staff and legal 
counsel for G.I.G., on September 14 and September 22, 2022 G.I.G. submitted another series of responses 
to the Bureau attempting to demonstrate that the Station was constructed and had been operating since 
April 2020.16  Included with its July and September Responses were declarations from viewers, program 
logs, certain financial information related to the operation of the station, a declaration from the Station’s 
tower owner, and photographs of the facility.17  
6. Upon review of G.I.G.’s July and September Reponses, Division staff determined that the 
information G.I.G. submitted was still incomplete.  Therefore, on September 26, 2022, the Division sent 
an inquiry letter to G.I.G. providing it one final time to provide documentation and information necessary 
to determine that the Station had been constructed and that grant of the Station’s late-filed license to cover 
is warranted.18  In its response filed on November 4, 2022, G.I.G. provided the additional documents 
requested by the Division.  It also reiterated that its failure to file a timely license to cover was inadvertent 
and that its request for additional time to construct filed in March 2021 was at the advice of its consulting 
engineer and it appears to have been in error.19  
13 Letter, from Barbara A. Kreisman, Chief, Video Division, FCC Media Bureau, to G.I.G., Inc. (May. 20, 2022) (on 
file under LMS main facility page for Facility ID No. 26041) (Inquiry Letter).  We note that because the 
construction permit had not yet been canceled in LMS, the Station was able to file a license to cover application 
against its expired construction permit.  Cancellation of a station’s construction permit and deletion of its call sign 
by Media Bureau (Bureau) staff in the Licensing and Management System (LMS) is an administerial function and 
does not constitute an official Commission action nor require any affirmative cancellation by the Commission.  See 
47 CFR §74.788(b) (2022) and supra note 2); Media Bureau Reminds Remaining Low Power Television and 
Television Translator Stations that the July 13, 2021 Digital Transition Date and Oher Important Deadlines are 
One Week Away, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 10364 (MB 2021).  As a result, failure by Bureau staff to cancel a 
construction permit in LMS does not result in an expired construction permit remaining valid.

7. G.I.G. maintains that grant of its License Application is “clearly in the public interest for 
stations to continue operation.”20  G.I.G. also argues that “that the appropriate penalty in this case should 
not be the draconian cancellation of the permit, but, rather, the imposition of a forfeiture.”21 
III. DISCUSSION
8. Pursuant to section 503(b)(1)(B) of the Act,22 a person who is found to have willfully or 
repeatedly failed to comply with any provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the 
Commission shall be liable to the United States for a forfeiture penalty.23  Section 312(f)(1) of the Act 
defines willful as “the conscious and deliberate commission or omission of [any] act, irrespective of any 
intent to violate” the law.24  The legislative history to section 312(f)(1) of the Act clarifies that this 
definition of willful applies to both sections 312 and 503(b) of the Act,25 and the Commission has so 
interpreted the term in the section 503(b) context.26  Section 312(f)(2) of the Act provides that “[t]he term 
‘repeated,’ when used with reference to the commission or omission of any act, means the commission or 
omission of such act more than once or, if such commission or omission is continuous, for more than one 
day.”27  
9.Apparent Violation.  The facts recited above appear to demonstrate that G.I.G. willfully 
violated section 74.788(a) of the Rules by failing to file a timely license to cover application upon 
completion of construction of the Station in April 2020.28  G.I.G. stated that its failure to timely file for a 
license to cover was inadvertent and its actions (or lack thereof) were taken at the advice of its 
engineering consultant.  However, it is well settled precedent that licensees are responsible for 
compliance with the Commission’s rules and that inadvertence does not excuse a violation or non-
compliance. 29  Furthermore, applicants and licensees are responsible for the errors of their staff.30  Even 
though the Station is currently silent, as a result of its failure to file a timely license to cover, G.I.G. also 
engaged in unauthorized operation for over two years (April 21, 2020 through July 27, 2022) in violation

311Federal Communications Commission DA 23-46
of section 73.1745 of the Rules31 and 301 of the Act.32  We therefore find that G.I.G. has apparently 
violated the Rules and Act and is apparently liable for forfeiture.
10.Proposed Forfeiture Amount.  The Commission's Forfeiture Policy Statement and section 
1.80(b)(10) of the Rules establish a base forfeiture amount of $3,000 for the failure to file a required 
form.33  The guidelines also specify a base forfeiture amount of $10,000 for construction and operation 
without an instrument of authorization for the service.34  In determining the appropriate forfeiture amount, 
we may adjust the base amount upward or downward by considering the factors enumerated in section 
503(b)(2)(E) of the Act, including “the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation, and, 
with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and 
such other matters as justice may require.”35  
11. In this case, G.I.G. failed to timely-file for a license to cover and engaged in unauthorized 
operation of the Station for over two years.  Taking into consideration all of the factors required by 
section 503(b)(2)(E) of the Act and the Forfeiture Policy Statement, we will reduce the forfeiture from the 
base amount to $6,500 because, as a low power station, KPCO-LP is providing a secondary service.36  
While in other cases we have fined other low power television and TV translator licensees $3,500 for 
similar violations,37 we believe an increased amount is warranted here given the lengthy period of time 
(over two years) the Station engaged in unauthorized operation compared to those other cases (four to six 
months).  Stations are only permitted to commence operation pursuant to a valid instrument of 
authorization and we find that G.I.G.’s failure represents extreme disregard of Commission’s licensing 
processes and the Act itself.  
12.Renewal Application.  In evaluating an application for license renewal, the Commission’s 
decision is governed by Section 309(k) of the Act.38  That Section provides that if, upon consideration of 
the application and pleadings, we find that: (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity; (2) there have been no serious violations of the Act or the Rules; and (3) there have been no 
other violations which, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse, we are to grant the renewal

Guidelines, Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 17087, 17113-15 (1997) (Forfeiture Policy Statement), recon. denied, 
Memorandum Opinion and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 303 (1999); 47 CFR § 1.80(b)(10), note to paragraph (b)(10), 
Section I.  See also Clear Channel, 26 FCC Rcd at 7157 (“We note that the staff may also issue Notices of Apparent 
Liability for ‘failure to file a required form’ as authorized by Section 503(b)(1)(B) of the Communications Act of 
1934, as amended (the ‘Act’) and Section 1.80 of the Rules, for such violations of covering license application filing 
deadlines or take other enforcement action.”).
34 A broadcast station requires an authorization from the Commission to operate.  See 47 U.S.C. § 301.
35 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)(2)(E); see also Forfeiture Policy Statement, 12 FCC Rcd at 17100; 47 CFR § 1.80(b)(10). 
36 See e.g., Southwest Colorado TV Translator Association, Memorandum Opinion and Order and Notice of 
Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, DA 21-1616 (rel. Dec. 21, 2021) (proposing $3,500 forfeiture for late filed 
application for license to cover and four months unauthorized operations) (paid Jan. 20, 2022); KAZT, LLC,

(rel. Mar. 28, 2022) (finding that although the station is secondary, a forfeiture in the amount of $6,500 was 
warranted given the lengthy period of time (over three years) the station engaged in unauthorized operation) (paid 
Apr. 19, 2022).

38 47 U.S.C. § 309(k).

application.39  If, however, the licensee fails to meet that standard, the Commission may deny the 
application—after notice and opportunity for a hearing under Section 309(e) of the Act—or grant the 
application “on terms and conditions that are appropriate, including a renewal for a term less than the 
maximum otherwise permitted.”40  
13. In this case, we find G.I.G.’s unauthorized operation of the Station, coupled with its lack 
of diligence and knowledge with regards to the Commission’s rules does not warrant routine license 
renewal.  Not only did G.I.G. fail to file the required license application, but this error was compounded 
by the filing of its construction permit extension that proved to be unnecessary and contain inaccurate 
information. The Licensee also engaged in a pattern of failing to fully reply to the Division’s inquiries, 
resulting in an extensive delay in resolving the Division’s investigation and ultimately depriving the 
public of the service being provided by the Station.
14. Despite this, we find that designation for evidentiary hearing is not warranted here.  
Instead, in addition to the proposed forfeiture, we put in place additional measures to ensure that the 
Station complies with the Act and the Rules in the future.  Specifically, pursuant to Section 309(k)(2) of 
the Act, upon resolution of the forfeiture proceeding commenced herein and so long as there are no other 
issues that would preclude grant, we will renew the Station’s license for a term of two years.  This short-
term renewal will afford the Commission an opportunity to review the Station’s compliance with the Act 
and the Rules and to take whatever corrective actions, if any, that may be warranted at that time.
15.Other Pending Matters.  In light of the facts and circumstances discussed above, and our 
findings that forfeiture and a short term renewal are sufficient sanction for G.I.G.’s apparent violations, 
we will grant G.I.G.’s request for waiver of section 74.788 of the Rules and reinstate the construction 
permit.41  We will act on KCPO-LP’s Silent STA, Engineering STA, and License Application under 
separate action upon conclusion of this forfeiture proceeding.

By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB) and the International Bureau (IB) 
grant, as conditioned below, two sets of applications and petitions for declaratory ruling regarding two 
separate transfers of control of JAB Wireless, Inc. (JAB Wireless) and its subsidiaries. 
WCB grants an application filed by JAB Wireless, Skybeam, LLC (Skybeam), Essex Telcom, 
Inc.  (Essex), and LStar Equity Company Holdings, L.P. (LStar Equity) (LStar Equity, together with JAB 
Wireless, Skybeam, and Essex, the LStar Equity Applicants), pursuant to section 214 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and sections 63.03-04 of the Commission’s rules, requesting 
approval for the 2018 transfer of control that occurred when LStar Equity acquired a controlling interest 
in Skybeam and Essex (LStar Equity Transaction).1  The LStar Equity Applicants consummated the  
transaction on November 7, 2018 without prior Commission consent.2

The 2018 LStar Equity Transaction (WC Docket No. 22-422)
Pursuant to an agreement dated May 2, 2018, the LStar Equity Applicants agreed to a series of 
transactions whereby LStar Equity converted certain debt and/or non-voting preferred stock into preferred 
and/or common stock, resulting in LStar Equity holding an equity interest of 71.8% and a controlling 
66.6% voting interest in JAB Wireless.19  The LStar Equity Applicants consummated the transaction on 
November 7, 2018 without prior Commission consent.  Upon consummation of the transaction, Skybeam 
and Essex became wholly owned, indirect subsidiaries of LStar Equity.20    
As a result of the completion of the LStar Equity Transaction, LStar Equity, a Delaware limited

The LStar Equity Petition for Declaratory Ruling (ISP-PDR-20221208-00012)
On December 8, 2022, JAB Wireless and LStar Equity (together, the LStar Equity Petitioners) 
filed a remedial petition for declaratory ruling (the LStar Equity Petition) pursuant to section 310(b)(4) of 
the Act, and section 1.5000(a)(1), requesting that the Commission find that it would serve the public 
interest to permit foreign ownership of JAB Wireless, above the 25% benchmarks in section 310(b)(4).  
The remedial LStar Equity Petition was filed to report the foreign ownership that occurred as result of the 
consummation of the LStar Equity Transaction. 
The LStar Equity Petitioners state that, as a result of the LStar Equity Transaction, LStar Equity 
holds a 71.8% equity interest and 66.6% voting interest in JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent of 
the Wireless Licensees.29  According to the petition, the remaining 28.2% equity interest and 33.3% 
voting interest in JAB Wireless is held by other investors, each holding less than 10% interest in JAB 
Wireless.30  The LStar Equity Petitioners contend that the limited partnership interests in LStar Equity are 
fully insulated in accordance with section 1.5003 of the Commission’s rules.31
As a result of the completion of the LStar Equity Transaction, LStar Equity is owned or 
controlled by Fund VIII Int’l (58% equity and voting) (Delaware), Fund VIII US (40% equity and voting) 
(Delaware), and LSF VIII Investments, L.P. (1.98% equity and voting) (Bermuda).32  LStar Management

PSPIB-RE Finance Partners II Inc. (6.7% equity, 16% voting) (Canada); and

Given that the LStar Equity Transaction has already been consummated and that the proposed 
acquisition of JAB Wireless by GI DI Iris Acquisition will remove the LStar Equity ownership in JAB 
Wireless, the LStar Equity Petitioners do not seek advance approval pursuant to section 1.5001(k) of the 
Commission’s rules for any of the foreign interests related to the LStar Equity Transaction.54 
We received no comments regarding foreign ownership interests of the LStar Equity Petition.  
Based on our review of the record, under section 310(b)(4) of the Act and the Commission’s foreign 
ownership rules and policies, we find that the public intertest would not be served by prohibiting foreign 
ownership of JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent, in excess of the 25% benchmarks in section

53 LStar Equity Petition, Exh. A at 10.  LStar Equity Petitioners contend that the limited partners of five entities 
should be considered insulated pursuant to section 1.5003 of the Commission’s rules.  The five entities are: (1) Fund 
VIII US, (2) Fund VIII International, (3) Fund IX US, (4) Partners VIII, and (5) Partners IX. LStar Petitioners 
further assert that such limited partners hold less than 10% equity or voting interest in LStar Equity.  According to 
the LStar Equity Petition, the Limited Partnership Agreement for Fund VIII US prohibits limited partners from 
taking part in the management or operation of the business and from exercising any control of the business.  LStar 
Equity Petitioners state that “[the Limited Partnership Agreement] does, however, include a single provision that 
allows removal of the general partner without cause by a 70% vote of the limited partners.”  LStar Equity Petitioners 
make similar arguments with respect to Fund VIII International, Fund IX US, Partners VIII, and Partners IX.  47 
CFR §1.5003; LStar Equity Petition at 11-14; LStar Equity Petition Dec. 8, 2022 Supplement at 1-2.  Since the 
LStar Equity ownership in JAB Wireless will be removed once GI DI Iris Acquisition acquires JAB Wireless, 
which, as discussed below, is contingent upon the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction closing within fifteen (15) days 
of release of this Public Notice, we find that it is not necessary to make a determination on this request at this time.

310(b)(4) of the Act.  We, therefore, grant the LStar Equity Petition subject to the conditions set forth 
herein.  This ruling authorizes 100% aggregate foreign ownership of JAB Wireless as the controlling U.S. 
parent of the Wireless Licensees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in section 1.5004 of the 
Commission’s rules.55 
As discussed below, grant of the LStar Equity Petition is conditioned on the removal of the LStar 
Equity ownership interest through the acquisition of JAB Wireless by GI DI Iris Acquisition within 
fifteen (15) days of the release of this Public Notice.  While the LStar Equity Petitioners continue to have 
an ownership interest in JAB Wireless and the Wireless Licensees, they have an affirmative duty to 
monitor their foreign equity and voting interests, calculate their interests consistent with the principles 
enunciated by the Commission, including the standards and criteria set forth in sections 1.5002 through 
1.5003 of the rules,56 and otherwise ensure continuing compliance with the provisions of section 310(b) of 
the Act.57  Failure to comply and/or remain in compliance shall constitute grounds for declaring this 
ruling terminated without further action on the part of the Commission.  Failure to meet a condition of 
this ruling may also result in monetary sanctions or other enforcement action by the Commission.

66 Id.  Skybeam and Essex, which are ETCs receiving fixed RBE support, will be affiliated post-consummation with 
ITS, an incumbent LEC that did not elect to receive fixed, model-based support and receives cost-based universal 
service support.  Dec. 13, 2022 Supplement at 1-2; GI DI Iris Acquisition Application at 12.  In the 
Hargray/ComSouth Order, the Commission found that “the combination of two companies that receive high-cost 
universal service support under different mechanisms, one fixed and one cost-based, could result in potential harm 
to the Commission’s goal of ensuring that limited universal service resources are distributed efficiently and 
effectively” as a result of the companies having an incentive to shift costs from the fixed, model-based support 
company to the cost-based support company.  Joint Application of W. Mansfield Jennings Limited Partnership and 
Hargray Communications Group, Inc. for Consent to the Transfer of Control of ComSouth Corporation Pursuant to 
Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, WC Docket 18-52, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 
4780, 4784, para. 19 (2018) (Hargray/ComSouth Order).  Although GI GP DI LLC is the general partner that will 
ultimately control Skybeam, Essex, and ITS, the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants assert that there is no ability to 
engage in improper cost shifting as a result of its affiliates receiving universal service support under different 
mechanisms.  Dec. 13, 2022 Supplement at 1-3.  The GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants affirm that the Skybeam and 
ITS do not have common control, shared or common costs, or consolidation of corporate books.  Id. at 2.  The 
Applicants state that GI DI Iris Acquisition, which ultimately controls Skybeam, and GI Blue Stream Holdings II LP 
(Blue Stream), the entity that ultimately controls ITS, “have different ownership, which precludes any consolidation 
of management or accounts between the two entities.”  Id.  They further state that “[t]he fiduciary duties that GP 
owes to the limited partners in each of the two non-overlapping co-invest partnerships . . . would preclude it from 
shifting costs from one partnership’s investment onto the partnership that holds another investment.  The transaction 
will therefore not have the type of common control that will implicate a mixed-support condition as envisioned in 
the Hargray/ComSouth Order.”  Id.; see Order on Reconsideration, WC Docket No. 20-389, 36 FCC Rcd 8859, 
8864, para. 14 (2021) (stating that WCB should continue to apply the Hargray/ComSouth condition to remedy a 
potential public interest harm caused by a mixed support transaction, including in transactions in which post-merger 
affiliates have common control, common costs, cost sharing, or consolidation of corporate books).  In light of the 
separate management control, cost accounting, and financial reporting of Skybeam and Essex and ITS, as 
demonstrated on this record, we do not find a potential public interest harm associated with a mixed support 
transaction that needs to be addressed, and therefore exercise our authority to exclude the GI DI Iris Acquisition 
Applicants from the Hargray/ComSouth condition.  We therefore grant the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application 
without applying the mixed support condition.

The GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition for Declaratory Ruling (ISP-PDR-20220610-00004)
On June 10, 2022, JAB Wireless and GI DI Iris Acquisition (together, the GI DI Iris Acquisition  
Petitioners) filed a petition for declaratory ruling (the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition) pursuant to section 
310(b)(4) of the Act and section 1.5000(a)(1) of the Commission’s rules, asking the Commission to find 
that it would serve the public interest to permit post-transaction foreign ownership of JAB Wireless, the 
direct controlling U.S. parent of the Wireless Licensees.
Pursuant to the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction, Merger Sub will merge with and into JAB 
Wireless with JAB Wireless being the surviving entity.72  Upon consummation of the transaction, the 
Wireless Licensees will remain wholly-owned subsidiaries of Skybeam, which in turn will remain a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of JAB Wireless.73  JAB Wireless will be directly, wholly-owned by GI DI Iris 
Acquisition with Wireless Licensees becoming indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of GI DI Iris 
Acquisition.74
As a result of the proposed transaction, GI DI Iris Acquisition, a Delaware limited liability 
company, will be wholly owned by GI DI Intermediate Inc., a Delaware corporation that is wholly owned 
by GI DI Iris Parent, a Delaware limited partnership.75  Iris Holdings, a Delaware limited partnership, 
holds 99.5% equity and 100% voting interests in Iris Parent.76  GI DI Iris GP LLC (Iris GP), a Delaware

of GI Manager LLC.83  The only beneficiaries of the Magnuson Living Trust are Richard Magnuson, 
Allison Magnuson, Taylor Magnuson, and Scott Magnuson, who are all U.S. citizens.84 
The GI DI Iris Acquisition Petitioners assert that the consummation of the proposed transaction 
will result in approximately 68% aggregate indirect foreign ownership of GI DI Iris Acquisition, JAB 
Wireless, and Licensees.85  This foreign ownership will arise through foreign entities that are currently or 
are expected to hold insulated limited partnership interests in GI DI  Fund-A LP (approximately 89.3% 
equity in the fund) and Iris Opportunity (up to 100% equity in the fund).86  Pursuant to section 1.5001(h) 
of the Commission’s rules,87 the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petitioners request up to 100% aggregate foreign 
ownership interest in the proposed controlling U.S. parent, JAB Wireless.88   
We received no comments regarding foreign ownership interests of the GI DI Iris Acquisition 
Petition.  Based on our review of the record, under section 310(b)(4) of the Act and the Commission’s 
foreign ownership rules and policies, we find that the public intertest would not be served by prohibiting 
foreign ownership of JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent, in excess of the 25% benchmarks in 
section 310(b)(4) of the Act.  We, therefore, grant the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition subject to the 
conditions set forth herein.  This ruling authorizes 100% aggregate foreign ownership of JAB Wireless as 
the controlling U.S. parent of the Wireless Licensees, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in 
section 1.5004 of the Commission’s rules.89  
According to the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition, upon consummation of the GI DI Iris 
Acquisition Transaction, no foreign individual or entity will hold a 5% or greater direct or indirect equity 
and/or voting interest in GI DI Iris Acquisition and Wireless Licensees.90  Therefore, the GI DI Iris 
Acquisition Petitioners do not request specific or advance approval for any foreign interest holder(s).91  
We note that, pursuant to Section 1.5001 and 1.5004 of the Commission’s rules, GI DI Iris Acquisition 
Petitioner is required to seek and obtain Commission approval before any foreign individual, entity, or

in-interest to such licensee as part of a pro forma reorganization, or any subsidiary or affiliate relying on such 
licensee’s ruling, shall file a new petition for declaratory ruling under § 1.5000 to obtain Commission approval 
before its foreign ownership exceeds the routine terms and conditions of this section, and/or any specific terms of 
conditions of its rulings; and (3) if at any time the licensee, including any successor-in interest and any subsidiary or 
affiliate knows, or has reason to know, that it is no longer in compliance with its foreign ownership rulings or the 
Commission’s rules relating to foreign ownership, it shall file a statement with the Commission explaining the 
circumstances within 30 days of the date it knew, or had reason to know, that it was no longer in compliance.  Id.

acquires an equity and/or voting interest of 10% or less, provided that the interest is exempt under 
1.5001(i)(3) of the Commission’s rules.92
Under this ruling, the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petitioners also have an affirmative duty to monitor 
their foreign equity and voting interests, calculate their interests consistent with the principles enunciated 
by the Commission, including the standards and criteria set forth in sections 1.5002 through 1.5003 of the 
Commission’s rules,93 and otherwise ensure continuing compliance with the provisions of section 310(b) 
of the Act.94  Failure to comply and/or remain in compliance with a condition of this authorization shall 
constitute grounds for declaring it terminated without further action on the part of the Commission.  
Failure to meet a condition of this ruling may also result in monetary sanctions or other enforcement 
action by the Commission. 
 
Executive Branch Review
Under our rules and procedures, the Commission will generally refer petitions for section 310(b) 
foreign ownership rulings for common carrier wireless applicants and licensees and all the associated 
applications to the Executive Branch agencies (Agencies) for their views on any national security, law 
enforcement, foreign policy, or trade policy concerns related to the foreign ownership of the 
Applicants/Petitioners.95 
We did not formally refer either the LStar Equity Application and Petition or the GI DI Iris 
Acquisition Application and Petition to the Agencies.96  As the Applicants state, the foreign ownership at 
issue in the LStar Equity Transaction will be removed by the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction.  
Consequently, we found as a matter of discretion, that it would not be an efficient use of resources for the 
Agencies or the Commission to refer the Application and Petition in these circumstances.97   We also find 
that because the only reportable foreign ownership in JAB Wireless and its subsidiaries will be through 
wholly owned intermediate holding companies and the ultimate ownership and control is held by U.S. 
citizens or entities, the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition come within the exclusion from 
referral to the Executive Branch for national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and trade policy 
review and thus we did not refer them to the Agencies.98  The decision not to refer the LStar Equity 
Petition to the Agencies is contingent upon consummation of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction 
92 47 CFR §§ 1.5001, 1.5004.  Section 1.5004(a)(1) states that a “‘100 percent aggregate allowance’ is subject to the 
requirement that the licensee seek and obtain Commission approval before any foreign individual, entity, or ‘group’ 
not previously approved acquires, directly and/or indirectly, more than 5 percent of the U.S. parent’s outstanding 
capital stock (equity) and/or voting stock, or a controlling interest, with the exception of any foreign individual, 
entity, or ‘group’ that acquires an equity and/or voting interest of 10 percent or less, provided that the interest is 
exempt under § 1.5001(i)(3).”  47 CFR § 1.5004.

within fifteen (15) days of the release of this Public Notice.  We also require the GI DI Iris Acquisition 
Applicants and Petitioners to file a consummation notification within three (3) business days of the 
consummation of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction.  If the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants and 
Petitioners do not file a consummation notice within that time frame, the grant of the LStar Application 
and Petition as well as the GI DI Iris Acquisition Application and Petition shall be rescinded and will be 
null and void, and consistent with its regular practice, the Commission will refer the LStar Equity 
Application and Petition to the Agencies.99  We also retain authority to pursue enforcement action by the 
Commission for non-compliance with the Act or the Commission’s rules. 
Grant of Applications and Petitions for Declaratory Ruling
We find, upon consideration of the record, that granting the domestic section 214 applications for 
the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction and the previous LStar Equity Transaction, which was 
consummated in 2018, will serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity,100 and will not impact 
the Domestic 214 Authorization Holders’ ability to meet RBE service, performance, and reporting 
obligations.101  The GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants remain obligated to comply with all applicable RBE 
requirements,102 including offering voice services on a common carrier basis in each RBE-supported 
area.103
 We also find that the public interest would not be served by prohibiting the foreign ownership of 
JAB Wireless, the controlling U.S. parent (related to the LStar Equity Petition), and the post-transaction 
foreign ownership of JAB Wireless (related to the GI DI Iris Acquisition Petition) in excess of the 25% 
benchmarks in section 310(b)(4) of the Act.  The LStar Equity Application and Petition and the GI DI Iris 
Acquisition Application and Petition, are granted as set out in this Public Notice.  
Grant of the LStar Application and Petition as well as grant of the GI DI Iris Acquisition 
Application and Petition are conditioned on the consummation of the GI DI Iris Acquisition Transaction 
within fifteen (15) days of release of this Public Notice and the GI DI Iris Acquisition Applicants filing 
the consummation notice within three (3) days after consummation.  A failure to comply with this 
condition will result in the recission of the grants which will be considered null and void.  
Further, grant of the LStar Application and Petition and grant of the GI DI Iris Acquisition 
Application and Petition are without prejudice to any enforcement action by the Commission for non-
compliance with the Act or the Commission’s rules and without prejudice to Commission action on other 
related, pending applications or petitions.

I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Order, we grant 37 appeals of decisions of the Universal Service Administrative 
Company (USAC) from E-Rate program participants seeking to correct ministerial or clerical errors 
associated with the invoicing process.1  We also grant one petition for reconsideration.2  The petitioners 
inadvertently made ministerial or clerical errors while completing their E-Rate request for reimbursement 
(i.e., FCC Form 472 (Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement (BEAR)) or FCC Form 474 (Service 
Provider Invoice (SPI)) form or while requesting an invoice filing deadline extension.  While these 
mistakes caused the reimbursement forms or invoice filing deadline extensions to be rejected or 
unprocessed, all filings were timely submitted in compliance with section 54.514(a) and (b) of the 
Commission’s rules.3  To the extent necessary, we also waive section 54.719(b) of the Commission’s 
1 See Appendix A.  The E-Rate program is formally known as the schools and libraries universal service support 
mechanism. 
2 We initially denied Wake County Public Schools’ request for review.  See Streamlined Resolution of Requests 
Related to Actions by the Universal Service Administrative Company, CC Docket No. 02-6, WC Docket Nos. 02-60, 
06-122, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 9927, 9936 (WCB 2020).  On reconsideration, Wake County Public Schools 
raises new facts demonstrating that we should grant the appeal.  Section 1.106(c)(2) of the Commission’s rules 
provides that a petition for reconsideration of a decision may rely on facts not previously presented to the 
Commission if consideration of the facts relied on is required by the public interest.  47 C.F.R. § 1.106(c)(2).

rules that requires applicants to seek review of a USAC decision from USAC in the first instance.4  We 
also grant seven appeals where the petitioners filed timely requests for reimbursement pursuant to section 
54.514(a) and (b) of the Commission’s rules, but were later denied funding because the petitioners failed 
to respond to USAC’s request for additional information regarding the submitted reimbursement form or 
extension request within the specified timeframe.5  
II. BACKGROUND
2.Invoicing.  E-Rate applicants select one of two ways to seek reimbursement of the costs 
of eligible E-Rate equipment and services.6  If an applicant pays the full cost of the equipment and 
services upfront, then the applicant must submit an FCC Form 472, the Billed Entity Applicant 
Reimbursement (BEAR) form, to request reimbursement for the discounted share of the costs from 
USAC.7  If an applicant only pays its service provider the non-discounted share of the cost of the eligible 
equipment and services, then the service provider must file an FCC Form 474, the Service Provider 
Invoice (SPI) form, to receive reimbursement of the discounted share of the costs directly from USAC.  
Before 2014, invoice filing deadline extension requests were governed by a USAC procedural rule that 
allowed applicants or service providers to request and receive a 120-day invoice extension under certain 
conditions.8  USAC routinely granted invoice extension requests that met its criteria, including requests 
made up to a year after the original invoice filing deadline.  This allowed for the resubmission of invoices 
in cases where E-Rate participants made ministerial and clerical errors on their forms.  In 2014, however, 
the Commission adopted a new E-Rate rule requiring applicants and service providers to submit invoicing 
forms for reimbursement to USAC no later than 120 days after the last day to receive service or 120 days 
after the date of the FCC Form 486 Notification letter, whichever is later.9  The Commission’s rules also 
allow an applicant or a service provider to receive a one-time 120-day extension of the invoice filing 
deadline for any cause, if the applicant or service provider requests the extension before the applicable 
invoice filing deadline.10  The Commission further explained that waivers of these rules would generally

not be in the public’s interest and directed the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) to grant waivers 
only under extraordinary circumstances.11  
3.Appeal/Waiver Rules.  In 2014, the Commission also amended its rules to require parties 
seeking review of USAC decisions to first file an appeal with USAC.12  Prior to the modification of this 
rule, a party could appeal an action or decision by USAC directly to the Commission.13  Now, however, if 
USAC denies a timely-filed reimbursement form, the applicant or service provider must first appeal that 
decision to USAC, within the 60-day deadline set forth in section 54.720 of the Commission’s rules.14  
When appealing USAC’s invoicing-related decision, an applicant or service provider is not required to 
file another reimbursement form or seek a waiver of the invoice deadline.15  
4.Ministerial and Clerical Errors.  In the 2006 Bishop Perry Order, the Commission found 
good cause existed to grant petitioners’ appeals where the applicants made immaterial clerical, 
ministerial, or procedural errors in filling out their FCC Forms 470 and 471.16  The Commission waived 
the minimum processing standards established by USAC in these instances, noting there was no evidence 
of waste, fraud or abuse, misuse of funds, or a failure to adhere to core program requirements.17  The 
Commission also found that the denial of funding requests inflicted undue hardship on the applicants and 
that rigid compliance with the application procedures did not further the purposes of section 254(h) of the 
Communications Act (Act), as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, or serve the public 
interest.18  In that decision and subsequent orders, relief has been granted to E-Rate participants for many 
types of ministerial and clerical errors on the FCC Form 471 and related forms,19 defined as errors one 
would make “when entering data from one list to another, such as mistyping a number, using the wrong 
name or phone number, failing to enter an item from the source list onto the application, or making an 
arithmetical error.”20  In 2011, the Commission permitted applicants to correct ministerial and clerical

errors on already-submitted FCC Forms 471 up until the date that the funding commitment decision letter 
is issued by USAC.21  The Commission explained that because of the complexity and detail involved in 
completing E-Rate forms and associated documentation, such errors may not be discovered until 
significantly after a request for funding was filed.22  The Bureau also expanded its relief for ministerial 
and clerical errors to the FCC Form 486 in instances where applicants submitted the form with the 
incorrect service start date, causing funding denials.23  These decisions noted that the minor mistakes at 
issue did not warrant the complete rejection of the FCC Forms 486 given that the applicants made a 
procedural error and did not violate a Commission rule.24  
5.Late or Missing Information Requests.  In addition to granting relief for ministerial and 
clerical errors, the Commission has also found that it is in the public interest to grant appeals in situations 
where E-Rate participants had funding reduced or denied because USAC-requested information was not 
submitted in the specified timeframe.25  The Commission determined that these appeals involved a 
procedural error on the part of the E-Rate participant, not a failure to adhere to a core program 
requirement or a misuse of funds.26  The Commission further found that these appeals involved a 
processing deadline, not a program rule.  Although deadlines are necessary for the efficient administration 
of the E-Rate program, in these cases, the Commission found that the applicants had demonstrated that 
rigid adherence to such procedures did not further the purposes of section 254(h) of the Act, or serve the 
public interest.27  While these decisions involved USAC’s information requests in the context of the 
processing the FCC Form 471,28 information requests are also necessary for correctly processing E-Rate 
reimbursement forms (i.e., FCC Forms 472 and 474).  Here, USAC has denied timely-filed 
reimbursement forms when applicants or service providers failed to respond within seven days to

III. DISCUSSION
6. In this Order, we consider several appeals from E-Rate participants that timely submitted 
reimbursement forms or invoice filing deadline extension requests but were denied funding because of 
ministerial or clerical errors on the forms or extension requests.30  We also consider appeals from 
applicants and service providers that were denied funding because they did not respond to USAC’s 
information request regarding timely-filed reimbursement forms or extension requests within the 
specified timeframe.
7.Ministerial and Clerical Errors.  The petitioners listed in Appendix A made ministerial 
or clerical errors when submitting their BEAR (FCC Form 472) or SPI (FCC Form 474) reimbursement 
forms when, for example, they inadvertently selected an incorrect last day of service from the invoice 
drop-down menu or otherwise entered a wrong billing, service or shipping date,31 inadvertently requested 
funding for the wrong funding year,32 entered the wrong service provider identification number,33 entered 
the wrong customer billed date on the SPI form,34 entered the wrong recipient of service on an invoice,35 
or entered the wrong application or funding request number on the BEAR or SPI form.36 
8. We also consider several appeals where the petitioners’ invoice filing deadline extension 
requests were denied or not processed because the requests contained ministerial or clerical errors.  Here, 
the petitioners inadvertently requested an invoice filing deadline extension for the wrong funding year or

wrong funding request number,37 or left off one or more funding request numbers from a timely-filed 
invoice filing deadline extension request due to a clerical or computer error.38 
9. We find that it is the public interest to grant the appeals included in Appendix A.  The 
Commission may waive any provision of its rules on its own motion or on petition for good cause 
shown.39  A rule may be waived where particular facts make strict compliance inconsistent with the public 
interest.40  In addition, the Commission may take into account considerations of hardship, equity, or more 
effective implementation of overall policy on an individual basis.41  In sum, a waiver is appropriate if 
special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule, and such deviation would better serve the 
public interest than strict adherence to the general rule.42
10. The petitioners in Appendix A argue that immaterial clerical, ministerial or procedural 
errors caused the rejection or denial of their otherwise-timely reimbursement forms or extension requests.  
The petitioners’ mistakes on these forms and requests are nearly identical to those mistakes made in the 
context of FCC Forms 470, 471, 486, and other related forms or submissions for funding under the E-
Rate program, discussed above, and we find that the same rationale for granting those requests applies 
here.  Namely, we find that petitioners submitted timely reimbursement forms or requests for an invoice 
filing deadline extensions to USAC pursuant to section 54.514(a) and (b) of the Commission’s rules.43  
However, those forms or requests were rejected or denied by USAC for the types of ministerial and 
clerical errors that the Commission has previously determined should be reconsidered by USAC on other 
E-Rate forms and requests.  We also find that the denial of funding inflicts undue hardship on the E-Rate 
participants and rigid compliance with the invoice filing deadline and invoice filing deadline extension 
rules does not further the purposes of section 254(h) or serve the public interest.44  In addition, we further 
find that there is no evidence of waste, fraud or abuse, misuse of funds, or a failure to adhere to core 
program requirements.45  
11. While applicants must file waivers to extend the invoice filing with the Commission,46 
USAC has the authority to accept evidence of a ministerial and clerical error on appeal and correct the 
issue on the submitted form or request.  Most petitioners included in Appendix A, however,  did not file 
an appeal with USAC based on the ministerial or clerical error found on their reimbursement form.  Some 
petitioners said USAC directed them to refile their reimbursement form, resulting in a denial because the 
new reimbursement form was submitted after the invoice filing deadline set forth in 54.514(a) of the 
Commission’s rules.47  Other petitioners filed a waiver directly with the Commission, either based on

their understanding of the rules or on the advice of USAC.48  Two petitioners’ appeal requests were 
denied because USAC treated them as waivers for the invoice filing deadline and dismissed the 
petitioners’ appeals because it did not have the authority to waive section 54.514(a) of the Commission’s 
rules.49  One appeal was denied by USAC for being filed more than 60 days after the adverse decision, 
although the appeal was actually timely based on the date of the FCC Form 472 (BEAR) Notification 
Letter.50  One appeal was denied by USAC, even though the petitioner documented the invoice’s 
ministerial and clerical error in its appeal.51  To the extent petitioners filed an appeal with the Commission 
in the first instance, we also waive our rule that requires parties to first file an appeal with USAC and 
direct USAC to treat their appeals as timely filed.52  
12. Based on the circumstances described by petitioners listed in Appendix A, we find good 
cause to waive our rules because of the substantial hardship and confusion caused by USAC’s invoice 
denials and incorrect guidance that applicants and service providers needed a waiver of the invoice filing 
deadline from the Commission before they could correct the clerical and ministerial errors on their 
reimbursement forms or extension requests. Thus, we waive section 54.719(b) of the Commission’s rules 
for the petitioners that appealed to the Commission first.  To the extent petitioners included in Appendix 
A also filed their appeals late, we further waive section 54.720 of our rules that require appeals be filed 
within 60 days from the date of the adverse decision.53  This is consistent with precedent where the 
Commission has waived the filing deadline when E-Rate participants had filed an appeal within 60 days 
of discovering or receiving notice of the ministerial or clerical error.54
13. Going forward, we direct USAC to review appeals of ministerial and clerical errors as 
described above and not to direct these petitioners to file waiver requests with the Commission.55

336Federal Communications Commission DA 23-48
Because the original reimbursement form (i.e., FCC Form 472 or FCC Form 474) was timely filed 
pursuant to section 54.514(a) of our rules, applicants and service providers should not be required to 
submit a new reimbursement form to correct the error in question, which may result in the form being 
denied because it was submitted after the invoice filing deadline.56  Instead, USAC should allow the 
applicant or service provider to correct the timely filed reimbursement form or extension request, and not 
require that a new form or request be submitted to correct the error.  We note that if a clerical or 
ministerial mistake of this type is discovered after the 60-day appeal-filing deadline,57 E-Rate participants 
should first file a waiver request with the Commission seeking a waiver of section 54.720 of the 
Commission’s rules and explain how and when the clerical or ministerial error was discovered.58
14.   Late or Missing Information Requests.  We also find that it is in the public interest to 
grant the appeals included in Appendix B where petitioners did not respond in seven days to USAC’s 
request for information about a timely-filed reimbursement form or extension of the invoice filing 
deadline request.  These petitioners did not meet the deadline to submit additional information concerning 
their form or request because they did not receive USAC’s request for additional information,59 or did not 
respond in a timely manner due to personnel issues.60  We find that the circumstances in these cases are 
nearly identical to those missing the deadline for responding to USAC information requests in the context 
of the FCC Form 471 applications, and the same rationale applies here.  Namely, we find that these 
appeals involved a procedural error on the part of the E-Rate participant, not a failure to adhere to a core 
program requirement or a misuse of funds.61  Further, these appeals involve a processing deadline, and not 
a program rule.  We find, as the Commission noted in the context of late or missing information when 
processing FCC Form 471 applications, that the petitioners have demonstrated that rigid adherence to 
such procedures does not further the purposes of section 254(h) of the Act or serve the public interest.62 
15. We encourage applicants and service providers to invoice early and timely request a one-
time 120-day invoice filing deadline extension if any issues arise or could arise regarding the invoice 
filing deadline set forth by section 54.514(a)-(b) of the Commission’s rules.  By building in additional 
time for the E-Rate invoicing process, problems caused by ministerial and clerical errors or missed 
information requests can be resolved with USAC, before the invoicing filing deadline expires without the 
56 47 CFR § 54.514 (requiring that invoices be submitted either 120 days after the last day to receive service or 120 
days after the date of the FCC Form 486 Notification Letter, whichever is later).  See supra para. 2.

CONNECT AMERICA FUND PHASE II AUCTION APPLICATION REVIEW 
CONCLUDES; LONG-FORM APPLICATIONS MADE PUBLIC
AU Docket No. 17-182
WC Docket No. 10-90
By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (WCB) announces the conclusion of the 
Connect America Fund Phase II auction (Auction 903 or CAF Phase II auction) long-form application 
review.  There were 195 authorized applicant state combinations, totaling $1.48 billion authorized in 10-
year support, covering 708,494 locations in 45 states.  Authorized bids included a range of performance 
tiers, with more than one-half of the winning bids at 100/20 Mbps or higher.  Additionally, 10 applicants 
were authorized to receive CAF Phase II auction support in conjunction with New York’s New NY 
Broadband Program totaling $65.49 million in 10-year support, covering 47,200 locations in New York.1  
All Auction 903 winning bids have been authorized or defaulted, with state-level summaries of 
authorizations posted under the “Data” tab on the Auction 903 webpage at 
https://www.fcc.gov/auction/903.  The summary provides for each authorized Auction 903 long-form 
applicant:  1) the total support amount over 10 years and total number of locations that the long-form 
applicant is authorized for in each state; 2) the total number of locations to which the authorized support 
recipient must offer the required voice and broadband services for each performance tier and latency in 
each state; and 3) the eligible census blocks included in the winning bids that are authorized in each 
state.2
 As part of the Rural Broadband Accountability Plan,3 the Commission is also making available 
additional information from the long-form applications submitted by applicants (FCC Form 683 and FCC 
Form 5625).  The Auction 903 FCC Form 683 long-form applications will be viewable through the 
application search feature, which can be accessed through the “Application” tab on the Auction 903 web 
page.4  The FCC Form 5625 long-form applications for New York applicants will be viewable on the 
“New York” tab on the Auction 903 web page.  The Commission will continue to withhold from routine 
public inspection information related to a long-form applicant’s detailed technology and system design 
description and its project funding description; financial information for which confidential treatment was

in New York in coordination with New York’s New NY Broadband Program).

study area code than it was originally assigned for its Auction 903 support.

We deferred action on the Application in response to the Committee'srequest. On December 21, 2022, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, on behalf of the Committee, filed a Petition toAdopt Conditions to Authorization and License. The Committee has no objection to the Commission granting the application, provided that theCommission conditions its approval on the assurance of Telxius Cable América, S.A., Telxius Cable USA, Inc., Telxius Cable Puerto Rico, Inc.,Telxius Cable Colombia Inc., Telefónica, S.A., Telxius Telecom, S.A., and Pontegadea Inversiones, S.L. to abide by the commitments andundertakings set forth in the December 9, 2022, Letters of Agreement (LOAs) attached to the Petition to Adopt Conditions to Authorization andLicense.
Telxius Cable América is a licensee on the BRUSA system (SCL-LIC-20160330-00011), the MAREA system (SCL-LIC-20160525-00012), the
Pacific Caribbean Cable System (PCCS) (SCL-LIC-20130122-00001), and the South America-1 (SAm-1) system (SCL-LIC-20000204-00003,SCL-MOD-20190826-00028). The BRUSA system connects Virginia Beach, Virginia; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro,Brazil. The MAREA system connects Virginia Beach, Virginia with Bilbao, Spain. PCCS connects the British Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Aruba,Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and the continental United States. The SAm-1 system connects Florida, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Brazil (Fortaleza,Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Santos), Chile (Arica and Valparaiso), Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala (Puerto Barrios and PuertoSan Jose), and Peru (Lurin and Mancora).
Telxius Cable América, a Uruguay company, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telxius Telecom, S.A. (Telxius Parent), a Spanish company. Pontel
Participaciones, S.L. (Pontel), a Spanish company, holds 60% equity and voting interests in Telxius Parent. Taurus Bidco S.à.r.l (Taurus Bidco), aLuxembourg company ultimately owned and controlled by KKR Management, a Delaware company, holds the remaining 40% equity and votinginterests and certain negative control rights over Telxius Parent. Telefónica, S.A. (Telefonica), a publicly traded Spanish company, holds 83.35%equity and voting interests in Pontel and ultimate de jure control over Telxius Parent. The remaining 16.65% voting and equity interests in Pontelare held by Pontegadea, a Spanish company, that is 99.99% owned by Mr. Amancio Ortega Gaona, a citizen of Spain.
The transaction will be comprised of a series of steps. First, the 40% equity and voting interests and negative control rights currently held by
Taurus Bidco in Telxius Parent will be acquired by Pontel. Simultaneously, Telefonica and Pontegadea will carry out a capital restructuring thatwill result in Telefonica holding 70% voting and equity interests in Pontel and Pontegadea holding the remaining 30% voting and equity interestsin Pontel. As soon as possible thereafter, Telefonica and Pontel will restructure their interests by merging Pontel into Telxius Parent, with TelxiusParent surviving, such that Telefonica (70%) and Pontegadea (30%) will hold their interests directly in Telxius Parent.
As part of the transaction, a Shareholder Agreement will be executed pursuant to which Pontegadea will acquire certain negative control rights
over shareholder, board of directors, and third-party transaction matters that could be deemed to constitute de facto control. The ShareholderAgreement gives Pontegadea certain rights beyond standard minority shareholder protections that will provide Pontegadea with an effective vetoover certain Pontel (and following the restructuring, Telxius Parent) matters, including business plan, annual budget, ability to enter into contractsabove a certain value threshold, ability to enter into related party transactions with Telefonica and its non-Telxius subsidiaries, and influence overthe appointment, replacement, and removal of the CEO and CFO. Following consummation of the transaction, Telefonica will continue to retainde jure control over Telxius Parent and Telxius Cable América.
After completion of the transaction, the following individuals and entities will hold 10% or greater direct or indirect interests in Telxius Cable
América: (1) Telxius Parent (100% equity and voting interests in Telxius Cable América); (2) Telefonica (70% equity and voting interests inTelxius Parent), in which no shareholder, as of February 1, 2022, holds an interest sufficient to give it a 10% or greater direct or indirect interestin Telxius Cable América at consummation; (3) Pontegadea (30% equity and voting interests in Telxius Parent and certain negative controlrights), and (4) Mr. Amancio Ortega Gaona (99.99% equity and voting interests in Pontegadea). According to the Applicants, there will be noother 10% percent or greater direct or indirect interest holders in Telxius Cable América.

Telxius Cable USA, a Florida company, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telxius Cable América, a Uruguay company, which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Telxius Telecom, S.A. (Telxius Parent), a Spanish company. Pontel Participaciones, S.L. (Pontel), a Spanish company, holds 60%equity and voting interests in Telxius Parent. Taurus Bidco S.à.r.l (Taurus Bidco), a Luxembourg company ultimately owned and controlled byKKR Management, a Delaware company, holds the remaining 40% equity and voting interests and certain negative control rights over TelxiusParent. The pro forma transaction did not affect the 60% interests in Telxius Parent held by Pontel.
The pro forma transfer of control was the result of an internal reorganization that brought about certain changes to the upper-tier corporate
structure of KKR Group Co. Inc. (formerly KKR & Co. Inc.) (Old Pubco), which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc. (formerlyKKR Aubergine Inc.) (New KKR Parent).

surviving company in the merger; (2) holders of common stock and Series C preferred stock in Old Pubco received the same number of shares andclass of stock of New KKR Parent; (3) Series I Preferred Stock of Old Pubco held by KKR Management LLP was converted into Series I
preferred stock of New KKR Parent having the same rights; and (4) Old Pubco, which was now a wholly owned subsidiary of New KKR Parent,
changed its name to KKR Group Co. Inc.
In Step 2 of the reorganization: (1) KKR Holdings L.P. became a subsidiary of New KKR Parent through a merger with a newly formed
subsidiary of New Pubco, KKR Aubergine Merger Sub I LLC (Merger Sub I), with KKR Holdings L.P. being the surviving company in themerger; (2) in connection with the merger of KKR Holdings L.P. and Merger Sub I, each limited partner of KKR Holdings L.P. received: (i) oneshare of common stock of New KKR Parent for each limited partner unit in KKR Holdings L.P. and (ii) such limited partner's proportionate shareof newly issued 8.5 million shares of New KKR Parent common stock; (3) as a result of the merger: (i) KKR Holdings L.P. changed its name toKKR Group Holdings L.P.; (ii) KKR Group Holdings Corp. became the general partner of KKR Group Holdings L.P.; and (iii) Series II preferredstock in Old Pubco was cancelled; and (4) New KKR Parent transferred all of its limited partner interests in KKR Holdings L.P. to Old Pubco,and Old Pubco contributed the number of limited partner interests representing 1% ownership of KKR Holdings L.P. to KKR Group HoldingsCorp. As a result of the mergers, New KKR Parent became the successor public company of the businesses of KKR and changed its name to KKR& Co. Inc.
KKR Management LLP, which controlled Old Pubco through its holding of the sole share of Series I Preferred Stock, now controls New KKR
Parent through its holding of the company's sole share of Series I Preferred Stock, which, among other things, continues to give KKRManagement LLP the power to elect the company's board of directors.

TO:
A notification was filed On June 2, 2022, Telxius Cable Puerto Rico, Inc. (Telxius Cable Puerto Rico), a Puerto Rico company that holds an
international section 214 authorization (ITC-214-20131121-00316), filed a notification pro forma transfer of control of negative control rightsover Telxius Cable Puerto Rico, effective May 31, 2022. Applicants filed a supplement on January 11, 2023.
Telxius Cable Puerto Rico is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telxius Cable América, S.A. (Telxius Cable América), a Uruguay company, which is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Telxius Telecom, S.A. (Telxius Parent), a Spanish company. Pontel Participaciones, S.L. (Pontel), a Spanishcompany, holds 60% equity and voting interests in Telxius Parent. Taurus Bidco S.à.r.l (Taurus Bidco), a Luxembourg company ultimately ownedand controlled by KKR Management, a Delaware company, holds the remaining 40% equity and voting interests and certain negative controlrights over Telxius Parent. The pro forma transaction did not affect the 60% interests in Telxius Parent held by Pontel.
The pro forma transfer of control was the result of an internal reorganization that brought about certain changes to the upper-tier corporate
structure of KKR Group Co. Inc. (formerly KKR & Co. Inc.) (Old Pubco), which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of KKR & Co. Inc. (formerlyKKR Aubergine Inc.) (New KKR Parent).
In Step 1 of the reorganization: (1) KKR Aubergine Merger Sub II LLC (Merger Sub II) merged with Old Pubco, with Old Pubco being the
surviving company in the merger; (2) holders of common stock and Series C preferred stock in Old Pubco received the same number of shares andclass of stock of New KKR Parent; (3) Series I Preferred Stock of Old Pubco held by KKR Management LLP was converted into Series I
preferred stock of New KKR Parent having the same rights; and (4) Old Pubco, which was now a wholly owned subsidiary of New KKR Parent,
changed its name to KKR Group Co. Inc.
In Step 2 of the reorganization: (1) KKR Holdings L.P. became a subsidiary of New KKR Parent through a merger with a newly formed
subsidiary of New Pubco, KKR Aubergine Merger Sub I LLC (Merger Sub I), with KKR Holdings L.P. being the surviving company in themerger; (2) in connection with the merger of KKR Holdings L.P. and Merger Sub I, each limited partner of KKR Holdings L.P. received: (i) oneshare of common stock of New KKR Parent for each limited partner unit in KKR Holdings L.P. and (ii) such limited partner's proportionate shareof newly issued 8.5 million shares of New KKR Parent common stock; (3) as a result of the merger: (i) KKR Holdings L.P. changed its name toKKR Group Holdings L.P.; (ii) KKR Group Holdings Corp. became the general partner of KKR Group Holdings L.P.; and (iii) Series II preferredstock in Old Pubco was cancelled; and (4) New KKR Parent transferred all of its limited partner interests in KKR Holdings L.P. to Old Pubco,and Old Pubco contributed the number of limited partner interests representing 1% ownership of KKR Holdings L.P. to KKR Group HoldingsCorp. As a result of the mergers, New KKR Parent became the successor public company of the businesses of KKR and changed its name to KKR& Co. Inc.
KKR Management LLP, which controlled Old Pubco through its holding of the sole share of Series I Preferred Stock, now controls New KKR
Parent through its holding of the company's sole share of Series I Preferred Stock, which, among other things, continues to give KKRManagement LLP the power to elect the company's board of directors. Prior to and after the transaction, KKR Management LLP remained inultimate control of Taurus Bidco S.à r.l (Taurus Bidco), which holds 40.0% equity and voting interests in Telxius Parent and certain negativecontrol rights. Telxius Cable Puerto Rico remained under the de jure control of Telefónica, S.A. (Telefónica Parent).
Upon consummation, the 10% or greater direct or indirect interest holders of Telxius Cable Puerto Rico are: (1) Telxius Cable América, S.A.
(Telxius Cable América) (100% equity and voting interests in Telxius Cable Puerto Rico); (2) Telxius Telecom, S.A. (Telxius Parent) (100%equity and voting interests in Telxius Cable América); (3) Pontel Participaciones, S.L. (Pontel), a Spanish entity (60.0% equity and votinginterests in Telxius Parent); (4) Telefónica, S.A. (Telefónica Parent), a publicly traded Spanish entity (83.35% equity and voting interests inPontel); (5) Taurus Bidco S.à r.l. (Taurus Bidco), a Luxembourg entity (40.0% equity and voting interests in Telxius Parent and certain negativecontrol rights); (6) Taurus Midco S.à r.l. (Taurus Midco), a Luxembourg entity (100% equity and voting interests in Taurus Bidco); (7) TaurusTopco S.à r.l. (Taurus Topco), a Luxembourg entity (100% equity and voting interests in Taurus Midco); (8) KKR Taurus Aggregator L.P., aCanadian entity (100% equity and voting interests in Taurus Topco).

section 214 authorization (ITC-214-20010427-00255), filed an application seeking consent to the transfer of control of NWMC resulting from the
conversion of limited partnership interests in NWMC held by Alltel Corporation (Alltel) into general partnership interests.  Alltel currently holds38.05% limited partnership interests in NWMC and no general partnership interests. The other partners of NWMC are Missouri StatelineCommunications, Inc., an Iowa corporation (approx. 20.44% general partnership interest and 0.21% limited partnership interest); Rock PortTelephone Company, a Missouri company (approx. 20.45% general partnership interest and 0.21% limited partnership interest); and Grand RiverCommunications, Inc., a Missouri corporation (approx. 20.44% general partnership interest and 0.21% limited partnership interest).
Prior to September 17, 2020, each of NWMC's four partners, including Alltel, held both general partnership and limited partnership interests.  On
that date, the partners amended the partnership agreement to convert the general partnership interest held by Alltel in NWMC to a limited
partnership interest through a pro forma transfer of control. See ITC-T/C-20200922-00170, International Authorizations Granted, Report No.
TEL-02049, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 11513, 11514 (IB 2020).

Specifically, Alltel will hold approx. 23.39%general partnership interest and 14.66% limited partnership interest in NWMC.  The proposed transaction will not change the interests held by theother partners.

FEBRUARY 7, 2023 MEDIA OWNERSHIP DIVERSITY SYMPOSIUM 
GN Docket No. 17-208
This Public Notice announces that the FCC’s Communications Equity and Diversity Council 
(CEDC) will host a Media Ownership Diversity Symposium on February 7, 2023, from 9:30 am to 4:45 
pm, ET.  The goal of the full-day symposium, “Expanding Digital and Media Ownership Opportunities 
for Women and Minorities,” is to explore the challenges as well as possible creative solutions to 
increasing ownership opportunities for women and people of color to achieve success and viewpoint 
diversity in all facets of media – TV, radio, cable, and streaming.  
Symposium participants will include:
  
➢Experts from both large and small media companies who have grown and thrived in the media and 
tech industries, as well as some entrepreneurs who did not sustain operations, despite their best 
efforts, and exited their businesses;
➢Research entities and thought leaders;
➢Advertising and marketing experts, as well as representatives from successful media/tech training 
programs. 
Panel presentations on research and trends in ownership and employment diversity will include: 
➢ Competitive Hurdles for Minorities in Media exploring competitive challenges for people of 
color, women, small and independently owned firms in media and tech, and probing ways to level the 
playing field.  The panel will examine how to incentivize the sale of stations to diverse owners, and 
the policy and regulatory measures that could create more robust competition in the media industry.  
➢Grooming Next-Gen Minority Leaders, CEOs & Owners, discussing best practices to cultivate the 
next generation of diverse media leaders, training and succession plans from college, through mid-
level development to C-Suite and to ownership.  Panelists will share strategies for bringing young 
diverse owners into the current media landscape of streaming, apps, gaming, coding, and social 
media, as well as traditional broadcast radio, television, and cable ownership.  
➢Show Me the Money: Access to Capital, Investors and Ad Dollars for Diverse Owners, exploring 
what incentives exist to fund or support diverse owners, including tax incentives.  The panel will also 
focus on the important role of access to increased advertising dollars by female and minority-owned 
media outlets.  
 
The detailed agenda for the Media Ownership Diversity Symposium will be released prior to the 
event.  The Symposium is scheduled as a hybrid event with participants both live and virtually presented.  
Attendees will have several opportunities to network and collaborate during the Symposium.  The

PUBLIC SAFETY AND HOMELAND SECURITY BUREAU SEEKS COMMENT ON 
REGION 34 (OKLAHOMA) 700 MHZ REGIONAL PLAN UPDATE
WT Docket No. 02-378
Comments Due: February 21, 2023 
Reply Comments Due: March 8, 2023
Introduction.  By this Public Notice, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau) 
seeks comment on the Region 34 (Oklahoma)1 – Regional Planning Committee (RPC) proposed 
modifications to its 700 MHz Public Safety Plan (Plan) for General Use2 spectrum in the narrowband 
segment of the 700 MHz band (769-775/799-805 MHz).3    
Background.  In 1998, the Commission established a structure to allow RPCs optimal flexibility 
to meet state and local needs, encourage innovative use of narrowband spectrum in the 700 MHz band, 
and accommodate new and as yet unanticipated developments in technology and equipment.4  Each of the 
fifty-five (55) RPCs is required to submit its plan for General Use spectrum.5  The Commission’s role in 
relation to the RPCs is limited to (1) defining the regional boundaries; (2) requiring fair and open 
procedures, i.e., requiring notice, opportunity for comment, and reasonable consideration; (3) specifying 
the elements that all regional plans must include; and (4) reviewing and accepting proposed plans (or 
amendments to approved plans) or rejecting them with an explanation.6 
The Region 34 700 MHz Plan Update.  On January 12, 2021, the RPC submitted an amendment 
to the Region 34 – 700 MHz Plan.7  In its amendment, the RPC proposes, among other things, to:
1 The Region 34 (Oklahoma) 700 MHz regional planning area includes the entire state of Oklahoma.
2 The General Use spectrum is administered by RPCs and is licensed for public safety services on a site-by-site basis 
in accordance with the relevant Commission-approved regional plan and frequency coordination. 
3 See Letter from Scott Walsh, Chair, Regional Planning Committee 34, to Chief, Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau, Federal Communications Commission, WT Docket No. 02-378 (dated Jan. 12, 2021) (Cover 
Letter).  See also Region 34 700 MHz Plan Update, WT Docket 02-378 (filed Jan. 12, 2021) (Plan Amendment).

377Federal Communications Commission DA 23-55
•Indicate that all “Pre-Assignment” channel pools have expired and that the RPC will now 
process all applications for General Use channels on a first-come, first-served basis;8
•Incorporate the State License channels into its plan but reserve them for site-by-site 
licensing to the state until all other “General Access” channels are allotted to other 
licensees;9
•Specify that operation on interoperability channels will be guided by the most recent 
version of the National Interoperability Field Operations Guide (NIFOG), the State of 
Oklahoma Statewide Communications Interoperability Plan (SCIP) and local Tactical 
Interoperability Communications Plans (TICP);10
•Incorporate the Air-to-Ground and former Reserve channels into its plan;11
•Designate six former Reserve channels for deployable trunked systems;12 
•Allow meetings of the RPC to be held in person or virtual.13
Region 34’s RPC received concurrence letters for the proposed Plan Amendment from its nine 
adjacent regions: Region 4 (Arkansas), Region 7 (Colorado), Region 16 (Kansas), Region 18 (Louisiana), 
Region 24 (Missouri), Region 29 (New Mexico), Region 40 (Texas - Dallas), Region 50 (Texas - El 
Paso), Region 52 (Texas - Lubbock).14  
We have reviewed the Region 34 Plan Amendment and find that it sufficiently complies with the 
applicable Commission rules and policies, and tentatively accept it.  
Request for Comments on the Region 34 Plan Amendment.  Prior to taking further action on the 
RPC’s proposal to amend its 700 MHz plan, by this Public Notice, we solicit comment on the Region 34 
Plan Amendment.  The Plan Amendment is available through ECFS at ecfs@fcc.gov under WT Docket 
No. 02-378.

CONSUMER AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS BUREAU ANNOUNCES COMPLIANCE 
DATE FOR AMENDED TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT RULES ON 
PRERECORDED CALLS
CG Docket No. 02-278
On December 30, 2020, the Commission released the TCPA Exemptions Order to implement 
section 8 of the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act 
(TRACED Act).1  In that rulemaking, the Commission amended the Telephone Consumer Protection Act 
(TCPA)2 rules related to exemptions for non-commercial calls to residential numbers; commercial calls to 
residential numbers that do not include an advertisement or constitute telemarketing; tax-exempt 
nonprofit organization calls to residential numbers; and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA)-related calls to residential numbers.3   
Specifically, the Commission adopted numerical limits on exempted artificial or prerecorded 
voice calls to residential lines (three calls per thirty-day period for most types of calls and one call per 
day, up to three calls per seven-day period for certain HIPAA-related calls).  The Commission also 
required callers making such exempt calls to allow consumers to opt out of any future calls that they do 
not wish to receive.4  These rule changes resulted in modified information collection requirements under 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved on 
September 15, 2021.5  The Commission explained in the TCPA Exemptions Order that it would publish in 
the Federal Register a compliance date for the amended rules, which would be six months following the 
date of publication.6

2 Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-243, 105 Stat. 2394 (1991), codified at 47 U.S.C.

Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 15188 (2020) (TCPA Exemptions Order).
4 Id.  As part of the TCPA Exemptions Order, the Commission also codified in its rules the existing exemptions for 
certain types of calls to wireless numbers, including calls by package delivery companies, financial institutions, 
prison inmate calling services, and healthcare providers.  See Federal Communications Commission, Limits on 
Exempted Calls Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 86 FR 11443 (Feb. 25, 2021).

publication of such notification in the Federal Register to come into compliance with the amended rules).
380Federal Communications Commission DA 23-56
After the Commission released the TCPA Exemptions Order, two parties asked the Commission 
to reconsider the new requirements.7  On December 27, 2022, the Commission released an Order on 
Reconsideration and Declaratory Ruling amending the rules to allow callers the option of obtaining either 
oral or written consent if they wish to make more calls than the numerical limits on exempted artificial or 
prerecorded voice message calls to residential telephone lines and affirming the numerical limits and opt-
out requirements on such calls.8  OMB approved this non-substantive rule change on January 4, 2023.  
On January 20, 2023, the Commission announced in the Federal Register that compliance with 
the amendments to 47 CFR §§ 64.1200(a)(3), (a)(3)(ii) through (v), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (d) is required as of 
July 20, 2023.9

residential telephone number to a company involved in the provision of their utility service, have given prior express 
consent to be contacted by that company at that number with informational messages that are closely related to the 
utility service so long as the consumer has not provided instructions to the contrary.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
Adopted: January 23, 2023 Released:  January 23, 2023
By the Chief, Audio Division, Media Bureau
  
I.         BACKGROUND
1. The Media Bureau (Bureau) has before it for comparative consideration a group of 
mutually exclusive (MX) applications for a new noncommercial educational (NCE) FM station 
construction permit.1  By this Memorandum Opinion and Order (Order), the Bureau performs a threshold 
fair distribution of service analysis and identifies the tentative selectee in this group.  Petitions to deny the 
application of this tentative selectee must be filed within 30 days of the date of release of this Order.2 
2. The group addressed in this Order consists of applications that were filed in November 
2021, during the filing window for new NCE FM applications.3  These applicants have had an opportunity 
to settle among themselves,4 and are now subject to a simplified, comparative process codified in Part 73, 
Subpart K, of the Commission’s rules.5  During the first step of this process, the Bureau, acting pursuant 
to delegated authority,6 uses service area population data, Tribal Priority criteria, and certifications 
provided by the applicants to perform a threshold fair distribution analysis.
1 On November 29, 2021, the Bureau issued a public notice identifying 231 groups of mutually exclusive NCE FM 
applications.  See Media Bureau Identifies Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications Submitted in the November 
2021, Filing Window for New Noncommercial Educational Stations, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC 
Rcd 16452 (MB 2021) (NCE MX Public Notice).  The group analyzed herein was included on the NCE MX Public 
Notice. 
2 See 47 CFR § 73.7004(b).
3 See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Application Filing Window; Window Open from November 2, 
2021, to November 9, 2021, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 7449 (MB 2021).  The window 
was available for FM reserved band (channels 201-220) proposals.  See 47 CFR § 73.501.   
4 See NCE MX Public Notice at 2-5.
5 47 CFR §§ 73.7000 – 7005.  
6 See Comparative Consideration of 76 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications, Memorandum Opinion and 
Order, 22 FCC Rcd 6101, n.16 (2007).  See also 47 CFR §§ 0.61 and 0.283.  A Section 307(b) analysis is ordinarily 
conducted at the staff level because the Bureau has delegated authority to make Section 307(b) determinations.  See 
Reexamination of Comparative Standards for Noncommercial Educational Applicants, Report and Order, 15 FCC 
Rcd 7386, 7397 (2000) (NCE Order).  In contrast, the point system analysis, which is conducted when Section 
307(b) is not determinative, must be conducted by the Commission as this analysis is considered a simplified 
“hearing” for purposes of 47 U.S.C. §155(c)(1).  See NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7420.
384Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 
II. THRESHOLD FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF SERVICE PROCEDURES
3. Section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Section 307(b)) states 
that the Commission must “provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution” of broadcast service 
among the states and communities.7  In accordance with this directive, the Commission considers the fair 
distribution of service as a first, or threshold, issue in its NCE FM comparative review process.8  
Accordingly, when applicants in a mutually exclusive NCE FM group9 propose to serve different 
communities, the Bureau first performs a threshold “fair distribution” analysis to ascertain whether grant 
of any of the applications would best further the Section 307(b) objective.10  In the first step of the Section 
307(b), or fair distribution, analysis, the Bureau determines whether any of the applicants in the MX 
group is a federally recognized Native American Tribe or Alaska Native Village proposing to serve Tribal 
Lands11 and claims the Tribal Priority.12  
4. If there is no Tribal Applicant in the MX group,13 the Bureau proceeds to the second step 
in the Section 307(b) analysis and determines whether any applicant would provide a first or second 
reserved band channel NCE aural service to a substantial population (the First or Second NCE Service 
Preference) and compares population coverage totals.14  Specifically, during this step, an NCE FM 
applicant is eligible to receive a fair distribution preference (or Section 307(b) preference)15 if it would 
provide a first or second reserved band channel NCE aural service to at least 10% of the population (in 
the aggregate), within the proposed station’s service area, provided that the population served is at least 
2,000 people.  If only one applicant in an MX group qualifies for the First or Second NCE Service 
7 47 U.S.C. § 307(b). 
8 See 47 CFR § 73.7002; NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7396 (concluding that “fair distribution of stations to 
communities should remain a threshold issue”), Memorandum Opinion and Order, 16 FCC Rcd 5074, 5077 (2001) 
(NCE MO&O) (“when competing FM applications propose to serve different communities, a proposal would be 
considered best, as a threshold matter, if it would provide service to a significant unserved or underserved 
population”).  
9 Conflicting NCE FM applications, which cannot all be granted consistent with the Commission's technical rules, 
are considered mutually exclusive.  An MX group consists of all applications which are MX to at least one other 
application in the group.
10 See 47 U.S.C. § 307(b) (“In considering applications for licenses . . . when and insofar as there is demand for the 
same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among 
the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each 
of the same.”); 47 CFR § 73.7002(a).  Applicants’ Form 2100, Schedule 340, Fair Distribution of Service 
certifications enable the Bureau to consider whether service to one community over the other would best achieve the 
Commission’s directive to distribute radio service fairly among communities. 
11 See 47 CFR §§ 73.7000, 73.7002(b).
12 An NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a fair distribution preference, and ultimately be awarded the 
construction permit, if it identifies itself as a Tribal Applicant, proposes Tribal Coverage, and proposes the first 
reserved channel NCE service owned by any Tribal Applicant at a community of license located on Tribal Lands 
(the Tribal Priority).  See 47 CFR § 73.7000 (defining a “Tribal Applicant” and “Tribal Coverage”); see also 47 
CFR § 73.7002(b); Policies to Promote Rural Radio Service and to Streamline Allotment and Assignment 
Procedures, First Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 1583 (2010) (establishing the Section 307(b) Tribal Priority).    
13 The MX group addressed in this Order does not contain a Tribal Applicant.  Accordingly, the first step of the 
Section 307(b) analysis, the Tribal Priority analysis, is unnecessary herein.
14 See 47 CFR § 73.7002(b).  
15 The terms “fair distribution preference” and “Section 307(b) preference” are used interchangeably to refer to the 
preference given to an MX application that is deemed to substantially further the fair distribution of service goals 
enunciated in Section 307(b) of the Act.
385Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 
Preference, its “fair distribution” (Section 307(b)) preference is dispositive,16 and the applicant will be 
awarded the construction permit.  
5. If more than one applicant in the MX group claims a First or Second NCE Service 
Preference, the applicant proposing to provide the greatest number of people with the highest level of 
service will be awarded a construction permit, if it will provide such service to at least 10% of the people 
within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 5,000 more people than the next best applicant.17  First 
service will be preferred over second service.18  Accordingly, the Bureau first examines the applicants' 
first service levels alone to determine whether one of the proposals is superior and should receive a 
decisive preference.  If such applicants are equivalent with respect to first service, or no applicant 
qualifies for a first service preference, the Bureau considers combined first and second NCE aural service 
population totals.  At each stage of the Section 307(b) analysis, any applicant that is comparatively 
disfavored in terms of Section 307(b) eligibility or service totals is eliminated.  The process ends when 
the Bureau determines that one applicant is entitled to a Section 307(b) preference, or that either (1) none 
of the remaining applicants can be selected or eliminated based on a Section 307(b) preference, or (2) 
each remaining applicant proposes to serve the same community.  Any remaining MX applicants 
proposing equivalent service overall, or proposing the same community, proceed to a point system 
analysis.19  
6. Each applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service preference must support its fair 
distribution claim with an exhibit identifying the population residing within the proposed station’s 60 dBµ 
service contour and the number of people that would receive a new first or second NCE aural service.20  
Further, any applicant which receives a decisive Section 307(b) preference is required to construct and 
operate technical facilities substantially as proposed, and cannot downgrade service to the area on which 
the preference was based for a period of four years of on-air operations.21
III. GROUP ANALYSIS 
7. This Section contains a narrative description of our analysis.  Unless otherwise noted, 
each component of the analysis is based on information provided by each of the respective applicants.22
16 As noted, in the case of an MX group with a Tribal Applicant, an applicant qualifying for a Tribal Priority, 
however, will prevail over any MX applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service Preference.
17 47 CFR § 73.7002(b).
18 Id.
19 See 47 CFR §73.7003 (point system selection procedures).
20 See id. § 73.7002(b).  Applicants were required to use the most recently available, i.e., 2010 Census, population 
data.  See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Filing Procedures and Requirements for November 2-9, 
2021, Window, DA 21-885, at 5-7 and n.24 (MB rel. July 23, 2021) (NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice); FCC 
Form 2100, Schedule 340, Instructions for Fair Distribution of Service at 12-14.  An applicant’s fair distribution 
showing must be computed as of the time of filing (close of the filing window for applications filed prior to the 
window) and cannot be enhanced thereafter.  See 47 CFR § 73.7003(e) and (f)(3); NCE Filing Procedures Public 
Notice at 11; NCE MO&O, 16 FCC Rcd at 5082-83.  However, an applicant that subsequently makes engineering 
changes that would diminish its fair distribution position must amend its application to reflect that diminished 
position.  See 47 CFR §§ 1.65 and 73.7003(e).  
21 See 47 CFR § 73.7005(b); see also 47 CFR § 73.7002(c).  During this period, such applicant may make minor 
modifications to its authorized facilities, provided that “(i) the modification does not downgrade service to the area 
on which the preference was based, or (ii) any potential loss of first and second NCE service is offset by at least 
equal first and, separately, combined first and second NCE service population gain(s), and the applicant would 
continue to qualify for a decisive Section 307(b) preference.”).  Id. 
22 See FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Noncommercial Educational Station for Reserved Channel Construction 
Permit Application, Fair Distribution of Service certifications.  An applicant responding “Yes” to any of the 
certification questions was required to submit an attachment with a justification for its certification.  
386Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 
8.Group 59B.23  This group consists of six applications to serve different communities in 
Florida and Georgia.  In Florida, Faith and Action Community Outreach, Inc. (Faith) proposes to serve 
Madison, and Big Bend Heritage Music Association, Inc. (Big Bend) proposes to serve Perry.  In 
Georgia, Elijah Radio (Elijah) proposes to serve Dasher; Georgia Public Telecommunications 
Commission (GPTC) proposes to serve Pelham; Church Planters of America (Church Planters) proposes 
to serve Quitman; and Bemiss Road Baptist Church and Lowndes County Christian Academy Inc. 
(Bemiss) proposes to serve Valdosta.  
9. Group 59B originally included two additional applicants, CSN International (CSN) and 
Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. (Inverse).  The Bureau initially performed a fair distribution analysis of the 
eight applications and identified Inverse as the tentative selectee in Group 59B.24  Inverse and CSN, 
however, subsequently requested dismissal of their applications.25  Accordingly, the Bureau conducted a 
second 307(b) analysis and identified Big Bend as the new tentative selectee of this group.26  However, 
Big Bend subsequently filed an amendment to its application in which it revised its population data and 
certified that it was not eligible for a fair distribution preference.27  Accordingly, we will perform a third 
fair distribution analysis of this group.
10. Elijah and GPTC each claims that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference based on 
combined first and second NCE population totals.28  The other applicants do not.  Accordingly, Big Bend, 
Faith, Church Planters, and Bemiss are each eliminated.  Elijah would provide a combined first and 
second NCE service to 12,723 people; and GPTC to 6,971 people.  Because Elijah’s proposed combined 
first and second NCE service exceeds GPTC’s proposal by at least 5,000 people, GPTC is eliminated.  
Elijah is the tentative selectee for Group 59B.
IV. ADDITIONAL MATTERS
11.Acceptability Studies.  Once the Bureau identifies a tentative selectee pursuant to the 
fair distribution analysis, the next step is to consider whether the selectee’s application has defects.29  If 
23 Group 59, which originally contained 17 applications, was bifurcated as a result of a technical amendment.  The 
other applications in the MX group were evaluated as Group 59A in a previous order.  See Comparative 
Consideration of 27 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial 
Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 22-61, at paras. 32-34 (2022).
24 See Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 13 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to 
Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-477 at 4-5, 
para. 11 (MB May 2, 2022). 
25 See File Nos. 167809 and 167493.
26 Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 5 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct 
New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-1166, at 4-5, para. 10 
(MB Nov. 9, 2022). 
27 See File No. 166291, Fair Distribution of Service Section and Attach. “Perry 210 Amendment Purpose.pdf” (filed 
Dec. 7, 2022).  
28 See File Nos. 167410 and 167018, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  Elijah’s 60 dBu 
contour encompasses 101,868 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 12,723 people.  
GPTC’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 19,136 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 
6,971 people.  Thus, each would provide combined first and second NCE service to at least 10% percent of the 
population within its respective 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people.
29  If a tentative selectee’s application is found unacceptable for filing, it is dismissed.  The applicant then has one 
opportunity to submit a curative amendment and a petition for reconsideration requesting reinstatement nunc pro 
tunc within 30 days, provided that the amendment is minor and does not alter the fair distribution analysis.  See 47 
CFR § 73.3522(b)(1).  A tentative selectee that is unable to cure the defect is disqualified.  47 CFR § 73.7004(d).   
387Federal Communications Commission DA 23-59 
the Bureau finds the application acceptable for filing, we announce acceptance by the release of this 
Order, and petitions to deny may be filed within 30 days following the release date of the Order.30
12. The Bureau has studied the application of the tentative selectee identified herein and 
determined that the application is acceptable for filing.  The tentative selectee identified in this Order 
appears to be fully qualified to become the licensee of the new NCE FM station it has proposed.  We 
tentatively conclude that the grant of the application would serve the public interest, convenience, and 
necessity.  It is our intention to grant the application if, after the 30-day petition to deny period has run, 
there is no substantial and material question concerning the grantability of the tentative selectee’s 
application.  Such determinations of grantability may, of course, involve additional matters that may 
impact the timing or outcome of a decision.  For example, a proposal to serve an area near the United 
States border with Canada or Mexico cannot become ripe for grant prior to the successful completion of 
international coordination.  
V. ORDERING CLAUSES
13.Group 59B.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that the tentative selection of the 
application of Big Bend Heritage Music Association, Inc. (File No. 166291), for authority to construct a 
new noncommercial educational FM station at Perry, Georgia, IS RESCINDED.
14. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Application filed by Elijah Radio (File No. 
167410) is TENTATIVELY SELECTED to be awarded a construction permit for a new NCE FM station 
in Dasher, Georgia and its application IS ACCEPTED FOR FILING, establishing a deadline thirty (30) 
days hereafter for the filing of petitions to deny.  If, after the petition to deny period has run, the Bureau 
finds on the basis of the application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice 
that there is no substantial and material question concerning the grantability of the tentative selectee’s 
application, and it is determined that grant of the application serves the public interest, we intend, by 
public notice, TO DISMISS the mutually exclusive applications of Big Bend Heritage Music Association, 
Inc. (File No. 166291), Faith and Action Community Outreach, Inc. (File No. 165985), Georgia Public 
Telecommunications Commission (File No. 167018), Church Planters of America (File No. 167096), and 
Bemiss Road Baptist Church and Lowndes County Christian Academy Inc. (File No. 167233), and TO 
GRANT the application of Elijah Radio (File No. 167410), CONDITIONED UPON that selectee’s 
compliance with section 73.7002(c) of the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR § 73.7002(c), which sets forth a 
four-year period of on-air operations substantially as proposed.

Dear Counsel:
We have before us the referenced application (Application) filed by Centro Cristiano de Vida 
Eterna San Antonio (CCVESA), which seeks authority to construct a new noncommercial educational 
FM station at Shiner, Texas,1 and has been designated the tentative selectee for NCE MX Group 196.2

Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-1166, at 5, para. 11 (MB Nov. 
9, 2022) (Fair Distribution Order).
389Also before us is a Petition to Deny (Petition) the Application filed by Texas Public Radio (TPR),3 and 
CCVESA’s response to a Letter of Inquiry sent by the Bureau.4  For the reasons set forth below, we grant 
the Petition,  rescind our tentative selection of the Application, dismiss the Application, and refer NCE 
MX Group 196 to the Commission to conduct a point system analysis.5
Background.  CCVESA filed the Application during the November 2021 filing window for new 
NCE FM applications.6  The Bureau determined that the Application was mutually exclusive with another 
application filed by CCVESA,7 and an application filed by TPR,8 and designated the three applications 
NCE MX Group 196.9  The Bureau later determined that the Application was entitled to a fair distribution 
preference, and designated it the tentative selectee of NCE MX Group 196.10
TPR timely filed the Petition.  Among other things, TPR asserts that Application should be 
dismissed because CCVESA failed to provide a proper site assurance exhibit.11  TPR notes that the 
Application lists a tower owned by American Tower Corporation (ATC) but includes contact information 
for an officer of Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC, a different tower company.12
To date, CCVESA has not opposed the Petition or amended the CCVESA-Shiner Application to 
correct the contact information provided.  However, it has responded to an LOI we sent, which requested 
information regarding whether, at the time it filed the Application, CCVESA had reasonable assurance 
that the site specified in the Application was available to it.13  In the LOI Response, CCVESA indicated 
that it had not contacted ATC directly but understood that Cody Peters at ATC had been contacted.14  
While the LOI requested “all documents … in the possession of [CCVESA] and its agents related to the 
availability of the proposed site,” CCVESA submitted no documentation with its LOI Response.

11 Petition at 3-4.  TPR also alleges that (1) the Application should not have been awarded a fair distribution 
preference, and (2) CCVESA underreported its existing authorizations in the Application.  Id. at 5-6.  Given our 
dismissal of the Application on site availability grounds, we need not and do not reach TPR’s other allegations.

Antonio, Application File No. 166134 (dated Nov. 23, 2021).
14 LOI Response at 1-2.
390Discussion.  We conclude that the CCVESA-Shiner Application is defective.  As TPR notes,15 
because the Application specified a site owned by ATC, CCVESA was required to specify the name of 
the person contacted about the site, the person’s telephone number, and the person’s status (i.e. owner, 
agent or authorized representative).  CCVESA submitted information regarding an individual employed 
by an unrelated tower company.16  To date, CCVESA has not amended the Application to correct this 
error.
We also find that, based on the record before us, CCVESA lacked reasonable assurance that the 
site specified in the Application was available at the time it filed the Application.  CCVESA has not 
submitted any evidence that it obtained reasonable assurance of the availability of the site specified in the 
Application.  This site availability defect is non-curable and renders the Application subject to dismissal 
without an opportunity to amend.17  Accordingly, we grant the Petition, rescind our initial tentative 
selection of the Application, and dismiss the Application. 
 In light of this finding, we conduct a new fair distribution analysis.  The remaining two 
applications in NCE MX Group 196 propose service to different communities in Texas.  Texas Public 
Radio proposes to serve Gonzales.  CCVESA proposes to serve Runge (CCVESA-Runge).  Each 
applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference based on first NCE service population totals.18  
TPR claims to provide new first NCE service to 4,175 people, and CCVESA-Runge claims to provide 
new first NCE service to 3,724 people.  The proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other 
by at least 5,000 people.19  Therefore, we consider combined first and second NCE service population 
totals.  TPR would provide a first or second NCE service to 16,542 people, and CCVESA-Runge would 
provide a first or second NCE service to 18,675 people.20  Because these proposals are also comparable, 
the fair distribution analysis ends here.  Accordingly, because we are unable to designate a tentative 
selectee under a section 307(b) fair distribution analysis, TPR and CCVESA-Runge will proceed to a 
point system analysis. 
The point system analysis, which is conducted when section 307(b) is not determinative, must be 
conducted by the Commission, as this analysis is considered a simplified “hearing” for purposes of 
section 155(c)(1) of the Act.21  Accordingly we have referred the matter to the Commission to make a 
determination under a point system analysis.22 
15 Petition at 4.
16 Application at Vertical Bridge Tower Contact Attach.
17 See Able Radio Corp., Letter Order, 26 FCC Rcd 16161, 16163 (MB 2011); Radio Delaware, Inc., Memorandum 
Opinion and Order, 4 FCC Rcd 8630, 8631, paras. 9-11 (Rev. Bd. 1989).
18 See Application File Nos. 166683 and 167130, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  TPR 
claims that it would provide first NCE service to 4,175 of the 17,649 people encompassed within its 60 dBu 
contour..  CCVESA-Runge claims that it would provide first NCE service to 3,724 of the 18,675 people within its 
60 dBu contour.  Thus, each applicant would provide first  NCE service to at least 10% of the population within its 
respective 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people.

By the Chief, Audio Division, Media Bureau:  
1. In this Order, we adopt the attached Consent Decree entered into by the Media Bureau 
(Bureau) and Associated Students of St. Mary’s College  (Licensee), licensee of S tation KSMC(FM) , 
Moraga, California  (Station) .  The Consent Decree resolves issues arising from the Bureau’s review of the 
captioned license renewal application (Application ) for the Station .  In particular, the Consent Decree 
resolves the Bureau’s investigation of Licensee’s compliance wit h the Filing Deadline  Rule and the 
Online Public Inspection File Rule contained in section s 73.3539(a) , 73.3527(b)(2)(i) , and 73.561(a) of 
the Commission’s rules (Rules) .1  The Bureau’s Audio Division suspended processing of the Application 
because Licensee did not comply with its renewal application filing deadline  and public file obligation s. 
2. The Licensee has shown that, at the time of the violations, the Station was a student -run 
noncommercial educational (NCE) station licensed to an educational institution and that the violations at the Station are first- time documentation violations within the parameters of our policy concerning 
violations of documentation requirements of Rules by student -run NCE radio stations.
2  The Bureau and 
Licensee have negotiated the attached Consent Decree in w hich Licensee  stipulates that it violated 
section s 73.3539(a)  and 73.3527(b)(2)(i) of the Rules .  Pursuant to the Consent Decree, Licensee agrees,  
among other things, to make a civil penalty payment to the United States Treasury in the amount of $500, 
implement a comprehensive compliance plan to ensure future compliance with its  online public 
inspection file obligations  and timely filing of renewal applications,  and, one year after entering into the 
Consent Decree, submit a  compliance report to the Audio Division.3 
 
1 See 47 CFR  §§ 73.3539(a), 73.35 27(b)(2)(i), 73.561( a) . 
2 See William Penn University , Policy Statement and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 6932, 6932, para. 2 (MB 2013) (in cases of 
“first -time violations of certain documentation requirements of our Rules by student -run NCE ra dio stations . . . 
instea d of issuing a  Notice of Apparent Lia bility (NAL), t he Bureau will first a fford the licensee a n opportunity to 
negotiate a consent decree in which the licensee agree to a compliance plan and makes a voluntary contribution to 
the United States Treasury.  In negotiating the  amount of the voluntary contributio n, the Bureau will consider the 
totality of circumstances, including giving appropriate consider ation to the station’s finances with respect to 
reducing the base forfeiture amount significantly. ”).   
3 License disclosed in the Application that the Station wa s silent for two periods without authorization: from 
February 2020 until August 20, 2020, and from September 10, 2021, to December 10, 2021.  Lic ensee explains  that 
first period of silence was initially because of a broken antenna, but the silence was exte nded because it wa s 
pa rtially a ttributable to COVID -19 related closures, while the second period of silence was due to concerns over RF 
safety levels.  We will not take any action for the first period of silence without STA was in part due to the COVID -

  3. After reviewing the terms of the Consent Decree, we find that the public interest will be 
served by its approval and by terminating all pending proceedings relating to the Bureau’s consideration 
of potential violations of the Rules . 
4. Based on the record before us, we conclude that nothing in that record creates a 
substantial and material question of fact as to whether Licensee possesses the basic qualifications  to 
remain a Commission licensee . 
5. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to s ection s 4(i) , 4(j),  and 503(b) of 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended,4 and by the authority delegated by sections  0.61 and

modification .

II. BACKGROUND 
3. Section 73.3539(a)  of the Rules requires that applications for renewal of license for 
broadcast stations must be filed “not later than the first day of the fourth full calendar month prior to the 
expiration date of the license sought to be renewed.”2  An application for re newal of the Station’s license 
should have been filed by August 1, 2021, the first full business day following the first day of the fourth 
full calendar month prior to the Station’s license expiration date of December  1, 2021.  The Station’s 
Application wa s not filed until December 1, 2021, the day the Station’s license expired.    
4. Section 73.3527(b)(2)(i)  requires radio station licensees to maintain an online public 
inspection file and to upload certain documents to the Commission’s public inspection file database throughout the year.
3  This includes  among other requirements,  the requirement that quarterly issues and 
programs lists be uploaded to the station’s online public inspection file no later than the tenth day after each quarter.  It is crucial that  stations maintain online public inspection files that are complete and up to 
date because the information in them directly affects, among other things, the public’s ability to be informed about a station’s compliance with its obligations.   
5. The Licensee recently filed the Application to  renew  its radio station license.  We have 
determined that the Licensee did not comply with either the Filing Deadline Rule or the Online Public Inspection File Rule.  Specifically, as noted in paragraph 3 above, the Licensee  failed to file the 
Application by August 1, 2021, and the Licensee failed to place any issues and programs lists in its online 
public file as required by the Online Public Inspection File Rule  prior to April 11, 2022.  Based on the 
Licensee’s failure to c omply with the Filing Deadline Rule and the Online Public Inspection File Rule , 
the Bureau commenced the Investigation and suspended processing the Application.   
6. The Bureau and Licensee have negotiated the terms of the Consent Decree that 
terminates the Investigation into the matters discussed above.  As part of the Consent Decree, the 
Licensee has agreed to make a settlement payment of Five Hundred Dollars ($500)  to the U.S. Treasury, 
and to implement and maintain a Compliance Plan designed to ensure its future compliance with the Rules noted above for one (1) year  after the Effective Date.

course.  In consideration for such, the Licensee agrees to the terms, conditions, and procedures contained herein.   
11. T
he Bureau agrees that, in the absence of new material evidence, the Bureau will not use 
the facts developed i n this Investigation through the Effective Date, or the existence of this Consent 
Decree, to institute, on its own motion or in response to any petition to deny or other third-party objection, any new proceeding, formal or informal, or take any action on its own motion against the Licensee concerning the matters that were the subject of the Investigation.

in the absence of new material evidence, it will not use the facts developed in the Investigation through the Effective Date, or the existence of this Consent Decree, to institute on its own motion any proceeding, formal or informal, or to set for hearing the question of the Licensee’s basic qualifications to be a Commission licensee or to hold Commission licenses or authorizat ions.

12. A dmission of Liability . The Licensee  admits for the purpose of this Consent Decree that 
it failed to timely  file its application for renewal of license, in violation of section 73.3539(a)  of the R ules.   
Licensee also admits that it failed to main tain an online public inspection file, specifically, that it did not 
upload any issues and programs lists, in violation of section 73.3527(b)(2)(i) of the Rules  during the 
Station’s prior license term. 
13. P ursuant to section 503(b)(2)(E) of the Act, in exercising its forfeiture authority, the

orders of the Commission after the Effective Date, whether related to the  timely filing of applications  or 
otherwise.

become a “Claim” or “Debt” as defined in s ection 3701(b)(1) of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 
1996.6

DECLARATORY RULING
Adopted:  January 23, 2023 Released:  January 23, 2023
By the Chief, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this declaratory ruling, we apply Commission precedent to ensure that millions of 
Americans can receive the information they need to maintain enrollment in Medicaid and other 
governmental health care programs to avoid losing health care coverage.  Specifically, we grant in 
significant part the request of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to confirm that 
federal and state governmental agencies working in conjunction with local governments, governmental 
contractors, and managed care entities acting under contract with state governments may, under certain 
circumstances, make autodialed and prerecorded or artificial voice calls or send autodialed text messages 
to raise awareness of the eligibility and enrollment requirements for these governmental health care 
programs without violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA).1  We also outline other 
ways HHS and its partners can reach consumers without running afoul of the restrictions of the TCPA.
2. The federal health care policies implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic 
changed the eligibility requirements for Medicaid and other governmental health care programs.  Those 
changes have resulted in a substantial increase in participation in these programs.2  When the 
government’s continuous enrollment requirement, which ensures that individuals enrolled in Medicaid 
throughout the pandemic are not at risk of losing coverage, comes to an end, millions of Americans will 
need to complete renewals necessary to redetermine their eligibility to remain in the program, a process 
complicated by staff shortages at state agencies that administer the Medicaid program.3  In this 
declaratory ruling, we help eligible consumers avoid coverage losses by confirming that federal and state 
governmental agencies and their contractual partners can communicate via automated calls and text

Rosenworcel, Chairwoman, FCC (April 28, 2022) (filed in CG Docket No. 02-278) (noting that millions of 
Americans will lose their Medicaid coverage when the public health emergency ends unless they take steps to renew 
eligibility) (HHS Letter).  We treat the letter as a petition for declaratory ruling.  See 47 CFR § 1.2.  
2 HHS Letter at 2 (noting that these programs provide health coverage to 86 million Americans and that enrollment 
has increased 20% since the start of the public health emergency).
3 See Amy Goldstein, Millions of vulnerable Americans likely to fall off Medicaid once the federal public health 
emergency ends, Washington Post (March 14, 2022) (indicating that as many as 16 million low-income Americans 
risk losing Medicaid coverage), www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/03/14/medicaid-loss-of-coverage/.

messages or prerecorded voice message calls with program enrollees about the steps necessary to retain 
enrollment in these health care programs.
II. BACKGROUND
A. TCPA
3. The TCPA generally requires “any person” making certain calls to obtain the recipient’s 
prior express consent before making the call absent an emergency purpose.4  In relevant part, the TCPA’s 
restrictions apply to “robocalls” made:  (1) using an automatic telephone dialing system or artificial or 
prerecorded voice to a wireless phone;5 and (2) using an artificial or prerecorded voice to a residential 
telephone line.6  The prohibition on using an autodialer to call a wireless number also applies to text 
messages sent using an autodialer.7  If a robocall includes or introduces an advertisement or constitutes 
telemarketing, consent generally must be in writing, after the caller makes certain disclosures (i.e., “prior 
express written consent”).8  And the Commission has made clear that a consumer simply providing their 
telephone number constitutes their “prior express consent” to be contacted at that number regarding 
information closely related to the purpose for which they provided the number, absent instructions to the 
contrary.9    
4. Separately, the Commission has clarified that federal and state governments making calls 
in the conduct of official business do not fall within the meaning of “person” in section 227(b)(1).10  As a 
4 See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1).
5 See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A); 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(1)-(2).  See Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 141 S.Ct. 1163, 1168-
73 (2021) (holding that to qualify as an “automatic telephone dialing system” under the TCPA, a device must have 
the capacity either to store a telephone number using a random or sequential number generator, or to produce a 
telephone number using a random or sequential number generator).   
6 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(B); 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(3). The Commission has exempted from this prohibition artificial 
and prerecorded voice calls to residential telephone lines that are not made for a commercial purpose and calls made 
for a commercial purpose that do not contain an unsolicited advertisement or constitute telemarketing.  See Rules 
and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CC Docket No. 92-90, Report and 
Order, 7 FCC Rcd 8752, 8773-74, paras. 40-41 (1992) (1992 TCPA Order) (noting that artificial or prerecorded 
voice messages that do not seek to sell a product or service do not tread heavily upon the consumer interests 
implicated by the TCPA).  
7 See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02-278, 
Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd 14014, 14115, para. 165 (2003) (2003 TCPA Order); see also Satterfield v. Simon & 
Schuster, Inc., 569 F.3d 946 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that text messaging is a form of communication used primarily 
between telephones and is therefore consistent with the definition of a “call”).
8 See 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(2)-(3), (b), (f)(9) (defining “prior express written consent”).
9 See 1992 TCPA Order, 7 FCC Rcd at 8769, para. 31.  In the ACA Declaratory Ruling, for example, the 
Commission clarified that a party who provides his or her wireless number to a creditor as part of a credit 
application “reasonably evidences prior express consent by the cell phone subscriber to be contacted at the number 
regarding the debt.”  Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Request 
of ACA International for Clarification and Declaratory Ruling, CG Docket No. 02-278, 23 FCC Rcd 559, 564, para.

Rcd 9054, 9064, para. 23 (2016) (confirming that the provision of a telephone number by a parent or student to a 
school provides prior express consent to receive communications from the school closely related to the educational 
mission of the school or to official school activities absent instructions to the contrary from the party who provides 
the phone number) (Blackboard Declaratory Ruling).

longstanding interpretive presumption that the word “person” does not include the federal government absent a clear

result, federal and state governmental callers and texters are not subject to the TCPA’s prohibitions on 
using automated equipment without the prior express consent of the called party.  On the other hand, 
contractors making calls on behalf of such governments, along with local governmental entities and their 
contractors, are “persons” subject to the TCPA, except in those cases where the federal or state 
government is so involved in placing the call as to be deemed to have initiated it.11 
B. HHS Letter
5. On April 28, 2022, HHS filed a letter requesting clarification that automated calls and 
texts or prerecorded telephone calls made to encourage individuals to renew enrollment with their state 
Medicaid program, Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Basic Health Program (BHP), or Health 
Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace) are permissible under the TCPA.12  HHS notes that the continuous 
enrollment requirement in Medicaid imposed by the public health emergency “extends through the end of 
the month in which the public health emergency ends, and state agencies may begin to terminate coverage 
for ineligible individuals at that time.”13  HHS indicates that millions of vulnerable Americans risk losing 
Medicaid coverage when the public health emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic ends.14  HHS 
contends that these coverage losses can be avoided if state governmental agencies and their partners are 
able to communicate via automated calls and text messages or prerecorded voice messages with enrollees 
about the steps required to retain their enrollment in these health coverage programs.15  
6. HHS notes that many state agencies and their partners, including local governments, 
contractors, and managed care entities under contract with state agencies, are considering the use of 
robocalls and robotexts to remind enrollees to respond to requests from Medicaid agencies to renew their 
enrollment during three phases of this process.16  During the first phase, all Medicaid enrollees, along 
with CHIP and BHP enrollees whose most recent renewal has been delayed due to the public health 
emergency, may receive text messages or prerecorded calls reminding them to contact their program to 
“affirmative showing of statutory intent to the contrary”) (2016 Broadnet Declaratory Ruling); Rules and 
Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Broadnet Teleservices LLC Petition for 
Declaratory Ruling, National Consumer Law Center Petition for Reconsideration and Stay, Professional Services 
Council Petition for Reconsideration, CG Docket No. 02-278, Order on Reconsideration, 35 FCC Rcd 15052, 
15059-61, paras. 22-26 (2020) (clarifying that state government callers in the conduct of official business do not fall 
within the meaning of “person” in section 227(b)(1)) (2020 Broadnet Order).
11 See, e.g., 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15059, paras. 18-21 (concluding that governmental callers rather 
than a contractor were the “maker of the call” because the governmental entity made all decisions regarding whether 
to make a call, the timing of the call, the call recipients, and the content of the call).  The Commission noted that 
determining whether a governmental entity or its contractor is the maker of the call is a highly fact-specific, case-by-
case inquiry.  See id. at 15059, paras. 19-20.
12 See HHS Letter at 1.
13 Id. at 5.  The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, Pub. L. No. 116-127, made increasing federal matching 
funds available for state Medicaid programs that meet specific requirements, including that they maintain the 
enrollment of most Medicaid enrollees through the end of the month in which the public health emergency ends.  On 
December 29, 2022, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act that decoupled the Medicaid 
continuous enrollment provision from the public health emergency and terminates this provision on March 31, 2023.  
As a result, states can resume Medicaid disenrollments beginning April 1, 2023.  States are required to maintain 
updated contact information, and make attempts to contact enrollees prior to disenrollment in Medicaid.  See 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328 (2022).
14 HHS Letter at 2 (citing an Urban Institute projection that 15.8 million people are at risk of losing Medicaid 
coverage). 
15 Id. at 3, 6 (noting that local governments play a critical role and often conduct determinations of Medicaid and 
CHIP eligibility and “managed care facilities” under contract with a state serve as important messengers on behalf of 
the state).
16 Id. at 3.
406Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
ensure their contact information is up to date.17  In the second phase, when renewals are being processed 
for Medicaid enrollees, along with regular annual renewals for CHIP and BHP enrollees, some 
individuals will need to provide additional information, such as updated income information to complete 
the redetermination of eligibility.18  These individuals may receive text messages or prerecorded calls 
reminding them to respond to their program.19  If they do not respond, these individuals may receive 
another reminder.20  
7. Lastly, in the event a determination is made that an individual is no longer eligible for the 
program for which they have enrolled, during the final phase, the individual may receive text messages or 
prerecorded calls explaining the actions that they can take to enroll in another health coverage program.21  
HHS indicates that no more than six to eight individual calls or messages will be made to any individual 
enrollee;22 once an enrollee has responded with the requested information, or has enrolled in another 
health care coverage program, the individual should not receive any additional calls or text messages.23
8. HHS offers two reasons supporting its request.  First, HHS contends that a consumer 
providing their telephone number when applying for a governmental health care program constitutes prior 
express consent to be contacted at that telephone number regarding eligibility for and ongoing enrollment 
in the program.24  Second, HHS urges that, because federal and state agencies are so involved in placing 
these calls by determining the content, timing, and recipient of the call or text message, the federal or 
state government is the maker of the call under the TCPA even if a third party is involved.25  
9. On May 3, 2022, the Commission released a Public Notice seeking comments on the 
issues raised in the HHS Letter.26  A wide variety of commenters including non-profit organizations, 
governmental entities, health insurance providers, and consumer groups expressed support for HHS’ 
requested clarification.27  In general, these commenters reiterate that millions of the most vulnerable 
Americans risk losing important health care benefits when the public health emergency comes to an end.28  
These commenters indicate that the use of autodialed calls and text messages are highly effective in 
reaching the most vulnerable groups such as low-income, elderly, and non-English speaking individuals 
with the information that they require to maintain these health care benefits.29  Although in agreement

407Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
with HHS that the provision of a telephone number upon application for a governmental health care 
program constitutes prior express consent under existing Commission precedent, NCLC suggests that the 
better grounds for relief when such telephone numbers have been reassigned to other users is a free-to-
end-user exemption rather than deeming the federal or state government the maker of the call.30  Two 
commenters express concerns that granting HHS’ request will result in an increased number of unwanted 
robocalls absent limitations to avoid abuse.31 
III. DISCUSSION
10. A critical component of the nation’s efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic is the 
ability of governmental agencies to communicate effectively with the public.32  As states resume routine 
renewals and other eligibility actions relating to governmental health care programs, their ability to 
communicate with Medicaid, CHIP, and BHP enrollees will be critical to successful retention of health 
care coverage for eligible enrollees.  
11. In this declaratory ruling, we confirm that enrollees’ provision of a telephone number on 
an application for coverage in Medicaid or other government health care programs constitutes prior 
express consent to be contacted at that number regarding enrollment eligibility and the other reasons HHS 
describes in its petition because the purpose of those calls and texts is closely related to the purpose for 
which the enrollees provided their numbers.  And we reiterate that, when the enrollee is no longer at that 
number or did not provide a number in the first place, federal and state governmental agencies may 
nevertheless use autodialers to call or send the text to reach those enrollees, despite a lack of prior express 
consent.33  We also emphasize that callers and texters have other options to contact enrollees without 
running afoul of the TCPA.34  Our clarification will enable government and partner callers to 
communicate time-sensitive, important information to millions of vulnerable American about maintaining 
their eligibility for critical health care benefits.  
12. As we have with past clarifications, we remind unscrupulous callers and texters that they 
should not view this as a retreat from our aggressive work to combat illegal calls and texts.  As the 
COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the United States, phone scammers have seized the opportunity 
30 See NCLC Reply Comments at 4-8.  In addition to ensuring that calls and texts are not charged to the recipient, 
NCLC suggests a number of other conditions including, among others, requiring that all callers check the 
Reassigned Numbers Database (RND), limiting prerecorded call messages to less than one minute, providing opt-
out information, limiting the number of calls and messages to one per day and a total of seven over a fourteen-day 
period, restricting calls and messages to certain hours, and requiring callers to make calls or send text messages via 
only those voice and text providers that can provide Caller ID reflecting the name and telephone number for the 
government agency on whose behalf the call is made and STIR/SHAKEN attestations.  Id. at 5-7.  NCLC also 
requests that the Commission take action to protect consumers from insurance scam calls that could be confused 
with legitimate calls from state governments and their contractors.  See id. at 11-12.  As noted below, we will 
continue to use our enforcement authority to aggressively combat such scams.
31 See Bailey Glasser Comments at 1; Shields Comments at 2-3.
32 See, e.g., Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 
02-278, Declaratory Ruling, 35 FCC Rcd 2840 (2020) (confirming that health care providers, state and local health 
officials, and other government officials may lawfully communicate health and safety information about COVID-19 
to protect individuals without violating the TCPA, pursuant to the “emergency purposes” exception).
33 As explained in the 2020 Broadnet Order, because the TCPA does not apply to the federal or state government 
calls, it cannot apply to federal or state government employees acting in their official capacities.  See 2020 Broadnet 
Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15057, 15059, n.38 & para. 22.
34 As discussed in greater detail below, we strongly encourage callers relying upon prior express consent to call or 
text enrollees to utilize the RND to determine whether the telephone number provided has been reassigned to 
another individual. 
408Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
to prey upon consumers.35  For example, we have received reports of scam and hoax text messages and 
automated calls relating to health care coverage.36  We will be vigilant in monitoring complaints about 
these calls and will not hesitate to enforce our rules when appropriate.
A. Prior Express Consent
13. Consistent with Commission precedent, we confirm that a consumer who provides their 
telephone number in an application form used to determine eligibility or seek benefits from Medicaid, 
CHIP, BHP, and Marketplace health care coverage has given their prior express consent to be called or 
texted at that number by local governments, governmental contractors, and managed care entities when 
acting under contract and pursuant to the authorization and direction of a federal or state agency with 
equipment covered by the TCPA regarding eligibility for and ongoing enrollment in those programs.37  
That is because these calls and texts contain information closely related to the purpose for which the 
consumer provided their telephone number.38  To bolster this view, as HHS indicates, these consumers 
sign an acknowledgment that “they may be contacted if more information is needed” when they apply for 
benefits.39  
14. We thus agree with HHS and commenters that by providing their telephone numbers on 
their benefits applications and acknowledging they may be contacted for more information, these 
consumers have given prior express consent to be called at that number under the TCPA regarding their 
enrollment eligibility.40     
15. Consumers who have applied for benefits in governmental health care programs expect 
and likely welcome calls and texts that inform them of requirements that may affect the provision of 
health care benefits for which they have applied, including the potential loss of coverage.  The reason 
consumers apply to such health care programs is to obtain the associated benefits; any reasonable 
consumer would view a call or text designed to prevent termination of benefits as closely related to the 
purpose for which they provided their telephone number.  We thus have no problem concluding that these 
calls and texts are closely related to the purpose for which enrollees gave their numbers when they 
applied for benefits.  We note, however, that any entity making calls in reliance upon the prior express 
consent created by the provision of a telephone number on an application for governmental health care 
benefits should be prepared to demonstrate that they are acting pursuant to the direction and authorization 
of a governmental agency to make calls or send text messages to enrollees.
35 See Federal Communications Commission, COVID-19 Consumer Warnings and Safety Tips 
https://www.fcc.gov/covid-scams (last visited Sept. 1, 2022).
36 Id. 
37 The Commission has made clear in several contexts that “persons who knowingly release their telephone 
numbers” for a particular purpose “have in effect given their invitation or permission to be called at the number 
which they have given” for that purpose, absent instructions to the contrary.  See, e.g., 1992 TCPA Order, 7 FCC 
Rcd at 8769, para. 31.  In the ACA Declaratory Ruling, for example, the Commission clarified that a party who 
provides his or her wireless number to a creditor as part of a credit application “reasonably evidences prior express 
consent by the cell phone subscriber to be contacted at the number regarding the debt.”  ACA Declaratory Ruling, 23 
FCC Rcd at 564, para. 9 (also confirming that the provision of a wireless telephone number to a creditor extended 
prior express consent to a third-party debt collector calling on behalf of the creditor to collect the debt related to that 
transaction).  
38 See, e.g., Blackboard Declaratory Ruling, 31 FCC Rcd at 9064, para. 23 (confirming that the provision of a 
telephone number by a parent or student to a school provides prior express consent to receive communications from 
the school closely related to the educational mission of the school or to official school activities absent instructions 
to the contrary from the party who provides the phone number).
39 See HHS Letter at 8.  
40 See, e.g., ACH Comments at 2; Amerihealth Comments at 1; Centene Comments at 1; NCLC et al. Comments at 
6-7; NYDH Comments at 2; TennCare Comments at 1.
409Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
16. We caution, as NCLC urges, that consumers in this context have not consented to calls or 
texts that contain advertising or constitute telemarketing.41  Consent to make an autodialed or prerecorded 
call or send an automated text that contains advertising or constitutes telemarketing, must be in writing 
and after certain disclosures.42  The mere provision of a telephone number does not satisfy these 
conditions.  Additionally, consumers may revoke prior express consent using any reasonable method—
orally or in writing.43  Callers relying upon prior express consent to make autodialed or prerecorded calls, 
therefore, must be prepared to honor revocation requests made by any reasonable means from recipients 
who no longer wish to receive calls and texts relating to governmental health care programs.44  We also 
note that the burden is on the caller to prove that it obtained the necessary prior express consent if any 
question arises as to whether prior express consent was provided by a call recipient.45  If so, callers will 
need to demonstrate that the telephone number called was provided on an application for governmental 
health care benefits.
17. Finally, we emphasize that even calls made to telephone numbers that have been 
provided by the called party may be subject to TCPA liability if the number has been reassigned from the 
person who provided consent.46  As NCLC notes, the Reassigned Numbers Database (RND) is a critical 
tool callers should use to avoid calling a person whose telephone number has been reassigned to another 
individual.47  Callers that make use of the RND can ensure that they are making the most efficient use of 
their limited resources by avoiding calls to unintended recipients while ensuring compliance with the 
TCPA.48  We therefore strongly encourage all callers relying upon prior express consent to utilize the 
RND before making such calls.
B. Federal and State Governmental Callers
18. Consistent with Commission precedent, we confirm that federal or state governmental 
agencies that take the physical steps to make autodialed, prerecorded voice, or artificial voice calls, or 
send text messages using an autodialer for the purposes HHS describes are not “persons” subject to the 
41 NCLC et al. Comments at 12.
42 See 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(2), (b).  The term “prior express written consent” is defined in 47 CFR § 64.1200(f)(9) 
(a consumer’s written consent to receive telemarketing robocalls must be signed and be sufficient to show that the 
consumer: (1) received “clear and conspicuous disclosure” of the consequences of providing the requested 
consent, i.e., that the consumer will receive future calls that deliver prerecorded messages by or on behalf of a 
specific seller; and (2) having received this information, agrees in writing to receive such calls at a telephone 
number the consumer designates).
43 See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02-
278, Report and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 7961 at 7996, para. 64 (2015) (2015 TCPA Order).
44 Id. at 7993, para. 55.  HHS indicates that each message will identify the agency that is sending the message or on 
whose behalf a message is sent and will provide the called party with information on how to opt out of or stop 
receiving future messages.  See HHS Letter at 5.
45 See 2015 TCPA Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 7989-90, para. 47; ACA Declaratory Ruling, 23 FCC Rcd at 565, para. 10.
46 See 47 U.S.C. § 227(b); 47 CFR § 64.1200(a); Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate Unlawful Robocalls, 
CG Docket No. 17-59, Second Report and Order, 33 FCC Rcd 12024, 12024-25, para. 1 (2018) (Reassigned 
Numbers Order).
47 NCLC et al. Comments at 8-9.  The RND is designed to prevent a consumer from getting unwanted calls intended 
for someone who previously held their phone number.  Callers and texters can use the RND to determine whether a 
telephone number may have been reassigned following a specific date so they can avoid potential liability for calling 
consumers who have not consented to these calls.  See 47 CFR § 64.1200(m).  The Reassigned Numbers Database 
can be found at www.reassigned.us.  
48 Callers may be eligible for a safe harbor if they can prove that they checked the most recent update of the RND 
and the database erroneously reported that the number had not been reassigned after the caller obtained consent.  47 
CFR § 64.1200(m); Reassigned Numbers Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 12043-44, paras. 53-58.
410Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
TCPA and their calls and texts do not, therefore, require prior express consent.  Thus, federal or state 
governmental callers do need not to obtain the prior express consent of the called party via the provision 
of a telephone number to make such calls or send such texts.
19. In the 2016 Broadnet Declaratory Ruling and the 2020 Broadnet Order, the Commission 
made clear that federal and state government callers are not “persons” subject to the TCPA’s restrictions 
if their calls are made in the conduct of official business.49  The Commission previously found that a 
caller may be found to have made or initiated a call in one of two ways:  first, by “tak[ing] the steps 
necessary to physically place a telephone call”; and second, by being “so involved in the placing of a 
specific telephone call as to be directly liable for initiating it.”50  Applying that precedent, we clarify that, 
when HHS or any federal or state agency “tak[es] the steps necessary to physically place” the calls or 
texts to enrollees in the governmental health care programs that HHS identifies in its Petition, the federal 
or state agency is the “maker” of such call and, therefore, such call is not subject to the TCPA.  
Informational calls made by federal or state government employees regarding enrollment and eligibility 
for governmental health care programs are “the conduct of official business” and nothing in the record 
indicates an affirmative showing to the contrary.  
20. We are unable on this record, however, to confirm that such federal or state agencies, 
when they are not “taking the steps to physically place” the call or send the text, are nevertheless “so 
involved” in the calls at issue to be deemed the maker or initiator of the communication when a third 
party is involved in a calling campaign.  The Commission has said that could occur when the federal or 
state government caller makes the decisions regarding whether to make a call, the timing of the call, the 
call recipients, and the content of the call, among other factors.51  This is a highly fact-specific, case-by-
case inquiry.52  No such specific facts are before us.  As HHS notes, there will be a wide variety of 
different calling campaigns involving third-party contractors that will vary from state to state.53  As a 
result, we decline to opine generally on this issue, and instead simply reiterate Commission precedent to 
guide callers in assessing their individual circumstances in each state and locality but cannot make a 
specific ruling on the “so involved” basis for finding a federal or state agency the maker of the call in any 
future calling campaigns.54  We note, however, that in the future we might be able to issue case-by-case 
guidance if HHS or another petitioner were to present us with more specific facts regarding a specific 
calling campaign and the respective roles of the government and any contractors in those situations.  
49 See 2016 Broadnet Declaratory Ruling, 31 FCC Rcd at 7399-41, paras. 12-15; 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC 
Rcd at 15059-61, paras. 22-26; see also NCLC et al. Comments at 3 (acknowledging Commission rulings that the 
TCPA is inapplicable to calls made by the federal government or its employees).  State and federal contractors, 
however, are “persons” under the TCPA and thus subject to TCPA restrictions.  2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd 
at 15059, para. 22.
50 DISH Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd at 6583, paras. 26-27.  The multi-factor analysis for determining liability 
of third parties under the TCPA is set forth in the DISH Declaratory Ruling, the 2015 TCPA Order, and the Dialing 
Services Forfeiture Order.  See DISH Declaratory Ruling, 28 FCC Rcd at 6583-84, paras. 26-27; 2015 TCPA Order, 
30 FCC Rcd at 7980-84, paras. 30-37; Dialing Services, LLC, Forfeiture Order, 32 FCC Rcd 6192, 6195-99, paras. 
9-18 (2017).
51 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd. at 15059, paras. 18-21 (these additional factors include the extent to which a 
person willfully enables fraudulent spoofing, and whether a calling platform knowingly allows clients to use the 
platform for unlawful purposes).
52 Id. 
53 See, e.g., Letter from Daniel Tsai, Deputy Administrator and Director, Department of Health and Human Services 
to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC at 2 (July 13, 2022) (filed in CG Docket No. 02-278) (noting that every state 
governmental health care program is unique) (HHS July 13 ex parte).
54 See, e.g., 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15059, paras. 18-21; 2015 TCPA Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 7978-84, 
paras. 25-37.
411Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
21. Lastly, we note that the Commission has acknowledged that federal and state contractors 
making calls on behalf of governmental entities may also qualify in some instances for forms of 
derivative immunity.  The Commission has stated that courts are best positioned to apply the body of 
existing immunity law to governmental contractors and make such determinations on a case-by-case 
basis.55  We, therefore, direct governmental contractors to this body of law to make determinations as to 
whether they may qualify for derivative immunity in this context. 
C. Other Options for Contacting Enrollees
22. We believe that the options we describe here—obtaining prior express consent and/or 
having a federal or state agency physically place a call—should ensure HHS and its partners can reach 
enrollees in a timely manner.  However, to the extent that there are limited situations in which callers do 
not have prior express consent to call or text a wireless telephone number, we confirm that there are a 
number of other options that callers have to communicate with those consumers without violating the 
TCPA.  
23.Calls to Residential Telephone Lines.  We confirm that calls made using an artificial or 
prerecorded voice message to a residential telephone line56 to raise awareness of the eligibility for and 
enrollment in Medicaid, CHIP, BHP, and Marketplace, as HHS has described them, are exempt from the 
prior express consent requirement as “calls made for a commercial purpose but [which do] not include or 
introduce an advertisement or constitute telemarketing”57 because these calls appear to simply inform 
enrollees about the state of their benefits and how to ensure they do not lose such benefits.  Nothing in 
HHS’s request suggests that these communications will advertise a particular insurance product or any 
other product or service, and thus they do not appear to be advertising or telemarketing.  As a result, this 
exemption is available for calls from local governments, governmental contractors, and managed care 
entities acting under contract and pursuant to the authorization and direction of a governmental agency in 
regard to determinations of eligibility for or enrollment in these governmental health coverage 
programs.58  Of course, if such calls do contain telemarketing or advertising, and are made by “persons” 
under the TCPA who lack derivative immunity as noted above, they would require prior express written 
consent.  And, in all cases, these calls must satisfy the Commission’s identification requirements if they 
use artificial or prerecorded voice messages.59
55 2020 Broadnet Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 15057, 15062, paras. 15, 28.
56 The TCPA does not define “residential telephone line.” We note that a number assigned to a wireless service is 
not a “residential telephone line” under section 64.1200 of our rules. Compare 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(1)-(2) with 47 
CFR § 64.1200(a)(3).
57 See 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(3)(ii)-(iii).  We note that the Commission recently amended its rules to limit the number 
of exempted calls that can be made to a residential line to three artificial or prerecorded voice calls within any 
consecutive 30-day period for three categories of exemptions.  This amendment has not, however, gone into effect.  
See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, CG Docket No. 02-278, 
Report and Order, 35 FCC Rcd 15188 at 15194, 15197, 15198, paras. 15, 28, 33 (2020).
58 See 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(3)(iii).  The term “advertisement” is defined to mean “any material advertising the 
commercial availability or quality of any property, goods, or services.”  47 CFR § 64.1200(f)(1).  The term 
“telemarketing” is defined as “the initiation of a telephone call or message for the purpose of encouraging the 
purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to any person.”  47 
CFR § 64.1200(f)(13).  HHS indicates that Medicaid and CHIP managed care entities may not include marketing or 
marketplace activities as defined by Medicaid-related managed care regulations in their automated calls and text 
messages or prerecorded voice calls.  See HHS Letter at 7 (citing 42 CFR § 438.104).
59 See 47 CFR § 64.1200(b).  All artificial or prerecorded message calls must, “[a]t the beginning of the message, 
state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that is responsible for initiating the call.”  In 
addition, “[d]uring or after the message,” such a call must “state clearly the telephone number (other than that of the 
autodialer or prerecorded message player that placed the call) of such business, other entity, or individual.”  Id. 
(continued….)
412Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
24.Communications Not Subject to the TCPA.  HHS and its partners have alternative options 
of communicating with enrollees that are not otherwise subject to the TCPA, and therefore may avoid 
TCPA restrictions altogether.  For instance, callers can use live operators rather than prerecorded voice 
messages and/or non-autodialed text messages.60  Further, they can use email or direct mail to contact 
enrollees.61  Although these methods may be somewhat less efficient than autodialed calls and texts or 
prerecorded messages, they nevertheless may offer a reasonable means to communicate important 
information to consumers without infringing upon the privacy rights protected under the TCPA.  
25.Free-to-End User Exemption Requests.  We decline to adopt a free-to-end-user 
exemption in this case as suggested by NCLC.62  We agree with HHS that the imposition of potentially 
burdensome conditions inherent in any free-to-end-user request may unduly hinder the effectiveness of 
critical outreach efforts by diverting the already limited resources of state and local governmental 
agencies to compliance with these conditions.63  Should conditions change, HHS and its partners are, of 
course, free to request a free-to-end-user exemption from the Commission.64
26. We believe that the guidance we provide today will assist HHS and its partners in 
complying with the TCPA while making these critical calls.  HHS and its partners may also configure 
their calling and texting efforts to further ensure compliance with the guidance set forth herein.  For 
instance, callers can now verify the prior express consent they have received by checking the RND to 
identify numbers that have been disconnected and possibly reassigned to other individuals and can use 
that information to assess whether alternative means of communication should be utilized.  We strongly 
encourage robocallers and robotexters to make use of this tool to avoid potential TCPA liability and to 
explore the options we identify here as well as any other options that may assist health agencies in making 
these critical calls.
IV. ORDERING CLAUSES
27. For the reasons stated above, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to sections 1-4 and 227 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151-154, 227, and sections 1.2 and 64.1200 of 
the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR §§ 1.2, 64.1200, and the authority delegated in sections 0.141 and 0.361 
of the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR §§ 0.141, 0.361, that this Declaratory Ruling is ADOPTED.
28. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the request filed by the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services on April 28, 2022, IS GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART to the extent 
discussed herein.
§ 64.1200(b)(1), (2).  There are additional requirements for artificial or prerecorded voice calls that include 
telemarketing but those requirements are not applicable in this context.
60 We caution, however, that a text message sent using a peer-to-peer platform requires consumer consent unless it 
“is not capable of dialing such numbers without a person actively and affirmatively manually dialing each one.”  
See, e.g., Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, P2P Alliance 
Petition for Clarification, CG Docket No. 02-278, Declaratory Ruling, 35 FCC Rcd 6526 at 6528, para. 8 (2020).
61 We decline to address whether HHS and its partners must comply with any legal requirements outside of the 
TCPA if they opt to send notices via e-mail or direct mail.  
62 See NCLC et al. Reply Comments at 4-8. See also 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(2)(C) (permitting the Commission to 
exempt, by rule or order, “calls to a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not charged to 
the called party,” subject to any conditions set by the Commission). 
63 See, e.g., CMMS/HHS Reply Comments at 2; HHS July 13 ex parte at 2 (noting the resource challenges involved 
in compliance with additional safeguards including potential cost restrictions).
64 Section 227(b)(2)(C) authorizes the Commission to adopt, by rule or order, exemptions from the prohibition on 
calls to “a telephone number assigned to a cellular telephone service that are not charged to the called party, subject 
to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary in the interests of the privacy rights this section is 
intended to protect.”  47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(2)(C).
413Federal Communications Commission DA 23-62
29. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to section 1.4 of the Commission’s rules, 47 
CFR § 1.4, this Declaratory Ruling shall be effective upon release.

UPDATED TOWER CONSTRUCTION GUIDANCE FOLLOWING THE 
RECLASSIFICATION OF THE NORTHERN LONG -EARED BAT AS ENDANGERED 
UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT  
On December 2, 2021, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal  
Communications Commission (Commission) issued guidance to the tower industry on the recommended 
steps for considering the potential effects that proposed facilities could have in the northern long -eared 
bat’s ( Myotis septentrionalis ) range  as part of an applicant’s environmental review .1  On November 29, 
2022, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)  announced a final rule to reclassify the northern long -
eared bat from being listed as threatened to being listed as an endangered species under the Endangered 
Species Act (ESA) .2  The final rule takes effect on January 30, 2023.  With this guidance, the 
Commission provides updated instructions for the industry following the effective date of the final rule.   
Background.  On April 2, 20 15, the northern long -eared bat was listed as threatened under the 
ESA due to the continued spread of white -nose syndrome .3  In January 2016, the Service  released a final 
4(d) rule4 and programmatic biological opinion5 requiring protective measures related to the northern 
long-eared bat .  Among other things, the Opinion provided an optional framework to applicants to 
streamline northern long -eared bat section 7 consultation (Streamlined Framework), pursuant to the ESA 
under certain circumstances.6

(Opinion ).   
6 Opinion at 4 -6. 
417 Federal Communications Commission  DA 23 -63  
 
 In 2016, the Bureau released a Public Notice setting forth guidance to applicants for using the 
Streamlined Framework for facilities that may affect the northern long -eared bat .7  The Bureau indicated 
that if the Streamline d Framework applied to a proposed facility, the tower owner was not required to 
submit additional documentation to the Commission.8   
In 2021, the Bureau issued further  guidance on using the Streamlined Framework.9  The Bureau  
directed applicants using t he Streamlined Framework to complete the automated determination key for 
the northern long -eared bat  through the Service’s Information for Planning and Consultation (IPaC) 
system and follow the Service’s process for federal actions.10   
On January 30, 2023 , the Service’s final rule reclassifying the northern long -eared bat as 
endangered under the ESA will take effect.11  Among other actions, the final rule removes the northern  
long-eared bat’s species -specific rule  issued under section 4(d) of the Act .12 
Discussion.  With this Public Notice , we notify applicants that the 4(d) rule and Streamlined 
Framework are null and void once the final rule takes effect on January 30, 2023.  Accordingly, an 
applicant must re -initiate Service consultation for any project  that is proposed or is in pre -construction 
status as of January 30 , 2023 and that relied on the 4(d) and Streamlined Framework.  The Service has 
announced that it is “developing other streamlining tools to assist” applicants with consultations for the 
northern long -eared bat , including a “rangewide northern long -eared bat  determination key” available 
through the IPaC, and an Interim Consultation Framework to help “ensure that projects in compliance 
with the 4(d) rule are not delayed.”13  The Service states  that the “new formal consultation framework will 
facilitate the transition from the 4(d) rule to typical Section 7 consultation procedures for federally  
endangered animals, until spring 2024 .”14   
We therefore direct applicants to consult with the Service’s resources15 and the applicant’s  
respective field Service office16 to determine how to proceed with the consultation process for any project 
affected by the Service’s final rule and  ensure continued ESA compliance .

WIRELINE COMPETITION BUREAU ANNOUNCES REVISED FILING DEADLINE 
OF MARCH 31, 2023 FOR BRINGING PUERTO RICO TOGETHER FUND AND THE 
CONNECT USVI FUND STAGE 2 MOBILE COVERAGE
WC Docket No. 18-143
WC Docket No. 10-90
In this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) announces a revised filing 
deadline of March 31, 2023 for the mobile network coverage milestone of the Bringing Puerto Rico 
Together Fund and the Connect USVI Fund Stage 2 mobile support recipients.1 
In 2019, the Commission adopted the PR-USVI Stage 2 Order, which made available $258.8 
million in Stage 2 high-cost support over a three-year period to mobile providers in Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands (Territories) to restore, harden, and expand 4G LTE and 5G technology for voice and 
broadband service in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria.2  In 2020, the Bureau 
authorized mobile support for several providers in the Territories and reminded all support recipients of 
their obligations, including the reporting and certification requirements due on January 30, 2023.3    
However, we conclude that a brief extension of time is necessary and warranted for these requirements to 
allow for additional development of the Commission’s data system for reporting and certifications.  This 
system and technical development will improve the recipients’ filing experience when submitting the 
mobile network coverage data pursuant to Section 54.1514(a), and allow better data integration with the 
ongoing Broadband Data Collection.  Additionally, in conjunction with the system development, the 
Bureau will release the data specifications associated with the submission of the mobile network coverage 
reporting and certification.  Accordingly, on our own motion, the Bureau waives the deadline provided in 
Section 54.1514(a) and announces the revised reporting deadline as March 31, 2023.  We find a limited 
extension is in the public interest.  
For these reasons, all Stage 2 Mobile support recipients will have until March 31, 2023 to file the 
required mobile network coverage report, certification, and applicable support data pursuant to Section 
54.1514(a).

ROBOCALL ENFORCEMENT NOTICE TO ALL U.S. -BASED VOICE SERVICE 
PROVIDERS  
FCC Enforcement Bureau Notifies All U.S. -Based Providers of Apparently Illegal Robocall 
Traffic from PhoneBurner Inc. and MV Realty PBC, LLC 
File No. EB-TCD-22-00033721  
 
By the Chief, Enforcement Bureau:  
The Enforcement Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) 
issues this Public Notice to notify all U.S.-based voice service provid ers about substantial amounts of 
apparently unlawful telephone  solicitation calls to phone numbers on the National Do Not Call (DNC) 
Registry1 from PhoneBurner Inc. (PhoneBurner) and MV Realty PBC, LLC. (MV Realty).  In these calls, 
MV Realty operators offered cash to homeowners in a purported exchange for giving MV Realty an 
exclusive right to list the homeowner’s property for sale .  Pursuant to section 64.1200(n)(2) of the 
Commission’s rules, we hereby  provide written notice to all U.S. -based voice service providers2 to 
take steps to effectively mitigate apparently illegal traffic3 from PhoneBurner and MV Realty.4 We 
consider blocking the traffic to be an example of effective mitigation.  
Purpose .  Protecting individuals and entities from the dangers  of unwanted and illegal robocalls is the 
Commission’s top consumer protection priority. As part of the Commission’s multi -pronged approach to 
combatting illegal robocalls, the Commission has taken steps to encourage  voice service providers to 
 
1 Federal Trade Commission, National Do Not Call Registry, https://www.donotcall.gov/.  
2 For the purposes of this document, the term “voice service provider” has a broad meaning that includes any entity 
originating, carrying, or terminating voice calls through time -division multiplexing (TDM), Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP), or commercia l mobile radio service (CMRS).  See Advanced Methods to Target and Eliminate 
Unlawful Robocalls , CG Docket No. 17 -59, Third Report and Order, Order on Reconsideration, and Fourth Further 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 7614, 7615 n.3 (2020).  
3 The Bureau believes that PhoneBurner and MV Realty engaged in the following illegal conduct: Making unlawful 
“telephone solicitations” in violation of 47 CFR § 64.1200(f)(15); leaving prerecorded voicemail telemarketing 
messages to consumers without consent  in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 227(b) and 47 CFR § 64.1200(a); making calls 
to phone numbers on the DNC Registry in violation of 47 U.S.C. § 227(c) and 47 CFR § 64.1200(c)(2); knowingly transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller identification information in violation of 47 U.S.C § 227(e)(1).  
4 47 CFR § 64.1200( n)(2).  Each notified provider must promptly investigate the identified traffic.  Each notified 
provider must then promptly report the results of its investigation to the Enforcement Bureau, including any steps 
the provider has taken to effectively mitigate the identified traffic or an explanation as to why the provider has reasonably concluded that the identified calls were not illegal and what steps it took to reach that conclusion.

itigate sus pected illegal robocalls.5  The Commission permits voice service providers to block traffic  
from other voice service providers that the Bureau has warned are transmitting suspected illegal 
robocalls.6  Additionally, s ection 64.1200(n)(2) of the Commission’s rules requires voice service 
providers to effectively mitigate robocall traffic when notified by the Bureau of ongoing unlawful call 
activity.7  
Background.   The USTelecom’s Industry Traceback Group (Traceback Consortium)8 traced a substantial 
volume of apparently unlawful telephone solicitation9 calls to PhoneBurner and MV Realty; the calls 
were placed  to homeowners whose phone numbers were on the DNC Regi stry.  In these calls,  MV Realty 
operators offered homeowners one -time cash payments, purportedly i n exchange for the homeowner 
granting MV Realty exclusive listing rights to sell the homeowner’s home at some future date .10  This 
traffic is identified in A ttachment A.   
PhoneBurner is “a cloud-based power dialer and outreach solution”11 headquartered in California.12  
PhoneBurner  employs software and a virtual portal that enables its clients to place robocalls, leave

9 A “telephone solicitation” refers to the initiation of a telephone call or message for the  purpose of encouraging the 
purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or services, which is transmitted to any person, but such term does not include a call or message: i)  To any person with that person's prior express invitation or permiss ion; 
(ii) To any person with whom the caller has an established business relationship; or  (iii) By or on behalf of a tax -
exempt nonprofit organization. ”  47 CFR § 64.1200(f)(15).  
10 Consistent with the Commission’s goals of preventing unlawful robocalls, the Commission collaborated with the 
Office of the Attorney General of Florida pursuant to a memorandum of understanding.  On November 29, 2022, the 
Office of the Attorney General of Florida filed a complaint against MV Realty and its corporate leadership fo r 
operating the “complex and deceptive scheme that attempts to skirt existing Florida law with the goal of swindling 
consumers out of their home equity.”  Office of the Attorney General, State of Florida, Department of Legal Affairs

rerecorded voicemails, and send text messages to thousands of consumers each day.13  PhoneBurner’s 
customers hire operators to place calls through a portal  that Phon eBurner owns and operate s.  Once 
logged into PhoneBurner’s software, these operators can  call the number s that PhoneBurner’s customers  
specify —in this instance, calls to homeowners.  PhoneBurner’s software offers several options.  Here, i f a 
homeowner  answers the call, PhoneBurner’s portal connects the MV Realty  operator s to the homeowner .  
If there is no response, PhoneBurner’s software leaves a prerecorded message and/or a text message using 
MV Realty’s preselected script.14  PhoneBurner’s  software also enables its customers to make robocalls 
that include false or misleading caller ID15—for example, by allowing its customers to match outbound 
calling number area codes to those of the recipients of their robocalls.16 
MV Realty is a realtor  based out of Delray Beach, Florida.17  MV Realty’s robocalls and prerecorded 
voicemails to phone numbers on the DNC Registry included messages offering homeowners several 
hundred to several thousands of dollars in exchange for signing a 40-year exclusive listing agreement with MV Realty.  At least three states have filed complaints against MV Realty alleging violations of consumer protection laws.
18  The Commission also received a complaint from a homeowner  who stated 
that they received three to five  unsolic ited voicemails from MV Realty each day.19  We consider blocking 
the traffic to be an example of effective mitigation. The Bureau identified an additional  26 complaints

called with an artificial or prerecorded voice message even if a live agent controls the initial artificial or prerecorded 
voice message using soundboard technology.  See Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer

18  The Florida complaint alleges that the calls deceived consumers by hiding the terms of MV Realty’s 
“Homeowner Benefit Program,” Consumers were led to enter a misleading contract under which MV Realty filed a 
40-year lien on their property that would require the consumer to pay three percent of the property’s value to MV 
Realty if the property is sold or the consumer wished to cancel the contract.   See Press Release, Fl a. Office of the

leging calls to phone numbers on the DNC Registry which were made to the Federal Trad e 
Commission.20   
MV Realty placed thousands of calls to numbers on the DNC registry .  A significant portion of MV 
Realty’s calls were placed to consumers who had their phones actively listed on the DNC registry.  The 
Enforcement Bureau’s investigation ide ntified 11,949,374 calls made to DNC registered numbers by 
PhoneBurner and MV Realty.21  The Bureau found that 10,926,635 calls were placed to wireless numbers 
and1,022,739 calls were placed to landline phone numbers actively listed on the DNC Registry.22   
The evidence indicates that MV Realty’s calls were telephone solicitations.  As discussed above, the MV 
Realty operators offered homeowners  cash in exchange for a listing agreement with the company —
essentially encouraging homeowners Purchase the company’ s services.  Further, the homeowners’  
complaints about MV Realty’s calls indicate that they did not give consent to be called and did not have an established business relationship with MV Realty.
23  The Bureau’s investigation revealed that MV 
Realty frequently called consumers who repeatedly and affirmatively asked MV Realty to stop calling them.
24  The Bureau spoke to former MV Realty employees who described how they were repeatedly 
asked by consumers to  stop calling.  In response to these requests, these employees marked the phone 
numbers as belonging to consumers who did not wish to be called.25  MV Realty  failed to remove these 
homeowners  from its calling list despite being notified by MV Realty’s own employees.26  As a result, 
MV Realty called the same consumers repeatedly.27 These repeated calls appear to violate the 
Commission’s telephone solicitation rules.28   
Further, PhoneBurner’s software left prerecorded voicemail messages with the scripted  solicitation when 
homeowners  did not answer MV Realty’s calls.29  These messages independently appear to violate the 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) and the Commission’s rules, as they are prerecorded voice telemarketing messages sent to consumers without consent.

he provider has taken to effectively mitigate the identified traffic or explain why the provider has 
reasonably concluded that the identified calls were not illegal and what steps it took to re ach that 
conclusion.32  In the event that any voice service provider fails to mitigate this traffic from 
PhoneBurner  and MV Realty or fails to explain to the Bureau why it reasonably concluded  this 
traffic to be legal, the Bureau may take additional enforcement action.33 
Partial Waiver of Reporting Obligation.   Pursuant to section 1.3 of the Commission’s rules,34 the B ureau 
finds that good cause exists in this instance to waive in part the reporting obligations otherwise required 
by section 64.1200(n)(2) of the rules.  In particular, the Bureau concludes that obligating all U.S. -based 
voice service providers to generate a written report documenting their investigation of the suspected 
illegal robocall traffic identified in this Public Notice  would result in an excessively voluminous record.  
Accordingly, a voice service provider shall not be required to file a report with the Commission if the provider determines that PhoneBurner or MV Realty are not customers of its services.   
Any provider filing a report in response to the aforementioned requirements must do so within 14 days of 
this Public Notice  and shall demonstrate  its ongoing efforts to mitigate the traffic associated with 
PhoneBurner or MV Realty.  Reports must be filed electronically by email sent to Kristi Thompson, 
Division Chief, Enforcement Bureau, Telecommunications Consumers Division, at 
Kristi.Thompson@fcc.gov ; with copies sent to Lisa Zaina, Asst. Chief, Enforcement Bureau,

PROPOSAL 
MB Docket No. 12-108
Comments Due:  [30 days after publication in the Federal Register]
Reply Comments Due:  [45 days after publication in the Federal Register]
With this Public Notice, the Media Bureau seeks comment on a proposal in the record of this 
proceeding that when the Commission is determining whether specific closed captioning display settings 
are readily accessible, it should consider the following factors:  proximity, discoverability, previewability, 
and consistency and persistence.  
In 2015, the Commission proposed rules that would require manufacturers of covered apparatus 
and multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) to make closed captioning display settings 
readily accessible to individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing.1  In January 2022, the Media Bureau 
released a Public Notice seeking to refresh the record on the proposals contained in the Second Further 
Notice.2  Comments were due February 17, 2022, and reply comments were due March 4, 2022.3  In 
response to the Closed Captioning Display Settings PN, a coalition of consumer groups proposed that the 
Commission should require closed captioning display settings to be proximate, discoverable, previewable, 
and consistent and persistent.4  The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) expressed concern about

the proposed factors, and asserted that further public comment was necessary.5  We believe that the 
Commission would benefit from further comment in this instance, and accordingly, this Public Notice 
seeks further comment on the 2022 proposal of the Consumer Groups in their comments to rely on these 
four factors to evaluate whether closed captioning display settings are readily accessible.
Interested parties should focus their comments on the specific issue of whether, if the 
Commission adopts rules governing the accessibility of closed captioning display settings, it should 
consider the four factors proposed by the Consumer Groups in 2022 – proximity, discoverability, 
previewability, and consistency and persistence – in determining whether closed captioning display 
settings are readily accessible.6  Should the four factors have the meanings the Consumer Groups 
proposed in 2022?  Should the factors be non-exhaustive, such that the Commission may consider 
additional factors as particular situations warrant?  Commenters should provide any other information 
relevant to the Commission’s determination of how to proceed on this issue.7
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.  The Second Further Notice included an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 603, exploring the potential impact on small entities of 
the Commission’s proposals.8  We invite parties to file comments on the IRFA in light of this request for 
further comment. 
Ex Parte Rules.  This matter shall continue to be treated as a “permit-but-disclose” proceeding in 
accordance with the Commission’s ex parte rules.9  Persons making ex parte presentations must file a 
copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral presentation within two 
business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the Sunshine period applies).

President, Research & Standards, Consumer Technology Association, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, MB 
Docket No. 12-108, at 4 (June 30, 2022) (claiming that the proposal to require these factors “has not been subject to 
notice and comment – and could not have been predicted when the FCC released either the Second Further Notice or 
recent Public Notice”).

Dortch, Secretary, FCC, MB Docket No. 12-108, at 3-4 (Sept. 20, 2022).  As proposed by Consumer Groups, 
“proximity” would involve consideration of the number of steps required to access closed captioning display 
settings, as well as whether closed captioning display settings are available on the same device as the video 
programming (Consumer Groups 2022 Comments at 9); “discoverability” would involve consideration of whether it 
is simple and intuitive for viewers to find closed captioning display settings (Id. at 9-10); “previewability” would 
involve consideration of whether viewers can preview the appearance of closed captions on programming on their 
screen while changing the closed captioning display settings (Id. at 10); and “consistency and persistence” would 
involve consideration of whether access to closed captioning display settings is “consistent . . . across devices and 
video platforms and across different applications on the same device” and persistent over time.  Id.
7 See, e.g., ACA Connects – America’s Communications Association Reply Comments, MB Docket No. 12-108, at 
13-14, n.33 (filed Mar. 4, 2022) (arguing that the Commission should not adopt the proposed factors because 
“locking in one user interface for all devices and platforms would squelch innovation to the detriment of closed 
captioning consumers,” because “consumers who do not like such interface would suffer a lack of alternatives,” and 
because “ACA Connects also cannot discern any authority under the TDCA for the Commission to adopt these 
additional proposed measures”).

ORDER
Adopted:  January 23, 2023 Released:  January 24, 2023
By the Acting Chief, Consumer Policy Division, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau:
1. In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Clear Rate Communications (Clear 
Rate) changed Complainant’s telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and 
verification from Complainant as required by the Commission’s rules.1  We find that Clear Rate has 
responded to the Complainant’s complaint and has taken action to resolve the complaint.
2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), prohibits the 
practice of “slamming,” the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscriber’s selection 
of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2  The Commission’s implementing 
rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier 
change may occur.3  Specifically, a carrier must: (1) obtain the subscriber’s written or electronically 
signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules; (2) obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a 
toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically; or (3) utilize an 
appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4  The Commission has also adopted 
rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require 
carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without 
authorization.5 
3. We received Complainant’s complaint alleging that Clear Rate had changed 
Complainant’s telecommunications service provider without Complainant’s authorization.  Pursuant to 
1 See Informal Complaint No. 5957279 (filed Jan. 9, 2023); see also 47 CFR §§ 64.1100 – 64.1190.
2 47 U.S.C. § 258(a).
3 See 47 CFR § 64.1120.
4 See id. § 64.1120(c).  Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or 
electronically signed authorizations.  Id. § 64.1130.
5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her 
bill.  If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability 
for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized 
change.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1160.  Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service 
provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber 
was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change.  Id.  Where the subscriber has paid 
charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commission’s rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of 
those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent 
of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1170.

our rules, we notified Clear Rate of the complaint.6  Clear Rate responded, stating that the Complainant 
had agreed to and authorized the carrier switch.7  It also provided two audio recordings—a third party 
verification recording (TPV) and a recording Clear Rate characterized as a “quality assurance call.”  The 
Division listened to each recording and determined that although the TPV complied with the verification 
requirements in the slamming rules, the person on the TPV is not the person on the “quality assurance 
call.”8  
4. Based on all of the information provided by Complainant and Clear Rate, it appears that 
Clear Rate has fully absolved Complainant of all charges assessed by Clear Rate in a manner consistent 
with the Commission’s liability rules.9  We therefore find that the complaint referenced herein has been 
resolved.10
5. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 258, and sections 0.141, 0.361 and 1.719 of the Commission’s rules, 47 
CFR §§ 0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Clear Rate Communications IS RESOLVED.
6. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order is effective upon release.

NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE
Adopted:  January 25, 2023 Released:  January 25, 2023
By the Chief, Enforcement Bureau:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. Under the rules and orders of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or 
Commission), telecommunications service providers and certain telecommunications providers 
(collectively, service providers) are required to file Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets 
(Worksheets) with the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) in furtherance of important 
regulatory programs implemented by the Commission pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (Act).  USAC and the administrators of Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) Fund, Local 
Number Portability (LNP), and the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) rely on information filed in 
the Worksheets to determine, as prescribed in Commission rules, each service provider’s equitable and 
accurate contributions responsibilities for the Universal Service Fund (USF) and these other federal funding 
mechanisms, consistent with the Communications Act and our rules.1  Likewise, the Commission relies on 
the information filed in Worksheets to assess equitable accurate federal regulatory fees owed by each 
service provider.  
2. Failure to file timely, complete, and accurate Worksheets undermines the Commission’s 
efforts to maintain the USF and these other federal programs arising under the Act.  The equitable 
administration of each of these federal payment requirements depends on the timely filing of Worksheets.  
In this case, Pacific Data Systems (Pacific or Company) failed repeatedly to file a total of 13 Worksheets 
between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.  We propose in this Notice of Apparent Liability for 
Forfeiture (NAL) a penalty of $100,000 against Pacific for its willful failure to comply with its obligations 
to file the Worksheet due on February 1, 2022, in apparent violation of sections 52.17(b), 52.32(b), 
54.711(a), and 64.604(c)(5)(iii)(B) of the Commission’s rules, and a Commission order.2 
II. BACKGROUND
A. Legal Framework
3. The Act codifies Congress’s historical commitment to promote universal service to 
ensure that consumers in all regions of the nation have access to affordable, quality telecommunications 
services.  In particular, section 254(d) of the Act requires, among other things, that “[e]very 
telecommunications carrier [providing] interstate telecommunications services . . . contribute, on an 
equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established 
1 See, e.g., 47 U.S.C. § 254(d); 47 CFR § 64.604(c)(5)(iii).
2 47 CFR §§ 52.17(b), 52.32(b), 54.711(a), 64.604(c)(5)(iii)(B); Wireline Competition Bureau Releases the 2022 
Telecommunications Reporting Worksheets and Accompanying Instructions, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 14176, 
Attach. B, Tbl. 3 (WCB 2021) (2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions).

by the Commission to preserve and advance universal service.”3  In implementing this Congressional 
mandate, the Commission directed all telecommunications carriers providing interstate 
telecommunications services to contribute to the USF based upon their interstate and international end-
user telecommunications revenues.4  The Commission also requires certain providers of interstate 
telecommunications to contribute to the USF.5  When a service provider fails to pay its share of 
obligations to the USF, it undermines the Congressional mandates embodied in section 254(d) of the Act.6  
Delinquent contributors also obtain an unfair competitive advantage over companies that comply with the 
universal service provisions of the Act and the Commission’s rules.7  
4. The Commission has established specific procedures to administer the USF.  Each 
service provider required to contribute to the USF is required to file annually an FCC Form 499-A, also 
known as the Annual Worksheet,8 and, with certain exceptions, to file quarterly an FCC Form 499-Q, also 
known as the Quarterly Worksheet.9  USAC uses the revenue projections submitted in the Quarterly 
Worksheets to determine each service provider’s monthly universal service contribution obligation, 
pursuant to the methodology prescribed by Commission rules.10  A service provider must timely file 
Quarterly Worksheets by February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year, and Annual 
Worksheets by April 1 of each year.11  The Commission’s rules explicitly warn service providers that 
failure to file timely forms or submit timely USF payments potentially subjects them to enforcement 
action.12  The Commission’s rules also require that the information contained in the forms must be 
truthful and that the USF payments must be accurate.13  The Commission’s equitable contribution scheme 
relies on the timely, complete, and accurate filing of Annual and Quarterly Worksheets by all service 
3 47 U.S.C. § 254(d).  
4 47 CFR § 54.706(b).  
5 Id. § 54.706(a) (“Entities that provide interstate telecommunications to the public, or to such classes of users as to 
be effectively available to the public, for a fee will be considered telecommunications carriers providing interstate 
telecommunications services and must contribute to the universal service support mechanisms.”). According to its 
2022 Annual Worksheet filing, Pacific provides CLEC services.  See https://apps.fcc.gov/cgb/form499/499a.cfm 
(last accessed Dec. 7, 2022).  A CLEC is a local exchange carrier that provides some or all of the interstate exchange 
access services used to send traffic to or from an end user.  See 47 CFR § 61.26(a)(1).
6 See Telseven, LLC, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, 27 FCC Rcd 6636, 6637, para. 2 (2012) (Telseven 
NAL), forfeiture issued, Forfeiture Order, 31 FCC Rcd 1629 (2016) (Telseven Forfeiture Order).
7 See id.
8 See, e.g., 47 CFR § 54.711; Telseven NAL, 27 FCC Rcd at 6637, para. 2.  Within 30 days of beginning to provide 
service, new service providers must register with the Commission by obtaining an FCC Registration Number (FRN) 
from the Commission Registration System (CORES) and obtaining a Filer ID from USAC’s E-File system.  See, 
e.g., 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2.  
9 See, e.g., 47 CFR § 54.711; 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2; Telseven 
NAL, 27 FCC Rcd at 6637, para. 2.      
10 Individual universal service contribution amounts that are based upon quarterly filings are subject to an annual 
true-up based on the Annual Worksheets.  See, e.g., 47 CFR § 54.711; Federal-State Joint Board on Universal 
Service, Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, 16 FCC Rcd 5748, 5752-53, para. 12 (2001).  
11 See, e.g., 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14199, Attach. 2, Tbl. 2.
12 47 CFR § 54.713(c).  
13 Id. §§ 54.711(a), 54.713.  An officer of a company completing an Annual Worksheet must certify, in part, as 
follows: “I have examined the foregoing report and, to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, all 
statements of fact contained in this Worksheet are true and that said Worksheet is an accurate statement of the affairs 
of the above-named company for the previous calendar year.”  2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 Rcd at 
14186, Attach. 1.  While the Commission permits revisions to Worksheets in certain circumstances, see id. at 14199-
14200, that opportunity does not affect the separate requirement to submit accurate information in the first instance 
to the best of the filer’s knowledge, information and belief.  See id. at 14186.
435Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68
providers.14  A service provider must provide USAC the Worksheets by each filing deadline so that 
USAC can issue monthly invoices assessing correct USF contribution amounts pursuant to the 
Commission’s rules and orders.15  A service provider shirking its Worksheet filing obligations therefore 
frustrates Congress’s policy objective to ensure the equitable and non-discriminatory distribution of 
universal service costs among all service providers.16 
5. USAC, administrators of other programs arising under the Act, and the Commission rely 
on the Worksheets service providers file to determine liability for, and subsequent billing and collection 
of, payments for important federal regulatory cost recovery requirements implemented under the Act.17  
The failure of a service provider to file every Quarterly and Annual Worksheet by each filing deadline 
could result in USAC relying on a smaller base of USF contributions revenues than would otherwise have 
been reported.  The Worksheet filing obligations are therefore necessary to ensure the integrity of the 
USF.  Furthermore, a contributor’s failure to comply with these filing requirements can impede the very 
purpose for which Congress enacted section 254(d)—to ensure that service providers contribute to USF 
on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis.  The negative effects on other programs arising under the 
Act that rely on assessments of the Worksheets are similar.  Indeed, a service provider that neglects to 
submit the most current, accurate revenue information in its Worksheets can evade its federal obligations 
to contribute fully towards the vital programs linked to the reporting obligations.18  As a consequence of 
this failure, other service providers might shoulder an unfair burden of the USF and other federal 
regulatory programs implemented under the Act.19   
B. Factual Background    
6. Pacific is a private corporation that is incorporated and headquartered in Guam.20  The 
Company has offered telecommunications services in Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
Marianas (CNMI), and Hawaii since 2004.21  In 2003, the Commission approved the Company’s 
application for authority to provide international telecommunications resale service under section 214 of 
14 See 47 CFR § 54.711.  The Commission and USAC may review records and documentation underlying revenue 
reported on a contributor’s Worksheets to determine whether the contributor is properly reporting revenue, and thus 
contributing its fair share to the costs of the universal service program.  See id. § 54.711(a); see also id. § 54.706(e).
15 See, e.g., 47 CFR § 54.711; 2022 Annual Worksheet Instructions, 36 FCC Rcd at 14237; Telseven NAL, 27 FCC 
Rcd at 6637, para. 2.
16 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(d).
17 The effective administration of the TRS Fund, see 47 CFR § 64.604; LNP; see id. § 52.32, NANP; see id. § 52.17, 
and federal regulatory fees, see id. §§ 1.1154, 1.1157, also rely on the accuracy of the Worksheets. 
18  See, e.g., Telseven NAL, 27 FCC Rcd at 6638-39, para. 6; Globalcom, Inc., Notice of Apparent Liability for

distance and local exchange interstate telecommunications services (voice and data services) in Guam.  These 
services are offered on a standalone basis.  See LOI Response at 3, Response to Question 15(b-c).  In addition to 
telecommunications services, Pacific provides information technology equipment sales, infrastructure construction,

the Act.22  On September 23, 2005, the Guam Public Utilities Commission granted a Certificate of 
Authority (COA) to Pacific Systems to be a service provider in Guam and provide local exchange 
services.23    
7. Pacific filed its first Annual Worksheet in 2003.24  Between 2003 and 2018, Pacific 
consistently filed its Annual and Quarterly Worksheets on time.25  However, between August 1, 2019, 
and, February 1, 2022, Pacific failed to file any of the 13 Worksheets required by the Commission’s 
rules.26  Although USAC repeatedly contacted Pacific concerning the Company’s missing Worksheet 
filings, the Company nonetheless failed to comply with its filing requirements.27 
8. On September 13, 2021, USAC referred this matter to the Enforcement Bureau (Bureau) 
for investigation of Pacific’s repeated failures to file Worksheets.28  On March 7, 2022, the Bureau issued 
an LOI to Pacific concerning the Company’s compliance with requirements arising under the Act and the 
Commission’s rules.29  On April 5, 2022, the Company filed its 2020 and 2021 Annual Worksheets,

LOI on April 6, 2022.31  In its LOI Response, Pacific acknowledged the Company’s failures to file 
required Worksheets, but claimed it was impeded by “staff shortages and COVID-19 issues.”32

9. Based on evidence developed through the Bureau’s investigation, the Company 
apparently violated sections 52.17(b), 52.32(b), 54.711(a), and 64.604(c)(5)(iii)(B) of the Commission’s 
rules and Commission orders by willfully and repeatedly failing to file the Company’s Worksheets due

between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.33  We propose a forfeiture of $100,000 for Pacific’s 
failure to file its Quarterly Worksheet due on February 1, 2022.  
10. Service providers, including local exchange carriers like Pacific, must file Annual 
Worksheets by April 1 of each year, and Quarterly Worksheets by February 1, May 1, August 1, and 
November 1 of each year.34  Pacific failed to file 13 Worksheets as follows: the Quarterly Worksheets due 
on August 1 and November 1, 2019, all 10 Worksheets due in 2020 and 2021, and the Quarterly 
Worksheet due on February 1, 2022.  The Company claimed in its LOI response it was “unable to 
complete the filings due to staff shortages and COVID-19 issues that existed at the time.”35  However, the 
Company did not describe in its LOI response the precise circumstances, severity, or duration of the “staff 
shortages and COVID-19 issues” it allegedly experienced, and why they consequently were unable to file 
the required Worksheets on time.36  Pacific has provided no basis to assess whether any alleged COVID-
19 issues were severe enough to impede the Company’s Worksheet filing compliance for several years.  
But even if this was the case, the proper course of action was to seek a waiver of the filing deadlines to 
obtain a deadline extension, not to ignore major regulatory requirements repeatedly.37  When USAC 
repeatedly contacted Pacific to remind the Company of the Worksheet filing requirements, Pacific did not 
raise any need for extensions of the filing deadlines.38  Instead, Pacific simply did not file the required 
Worksheets for several years. 
11. We consider each individual failure to file a Worksheet by each filing deadline a separate 
violation of sections 52.17(b), 52.32(b), 54.711(a), and 64.604(c)(5)(iii)(B) of the Commission’s rules 
and Commission orders.39  We find that the Company apparently violated sections 52.17(b), 52.32(b), 
54.711(a), and 64.604(c)(5)(iii)(B) of the Commission’s rules and Commission orders 13 separate times

entity that “willfully or repeatedly fail[s] to comply with any of the provisions of [the Act] or of any rule, 
regulation, or order issued by the Commission.”41  For the violations at issue here, section 503(b)(2)(B) of

40 As explained further below, we propose a forfeiture for only one apparent violation because the other apparent 
violations occurred outside of the applicable statute of limitations.
41 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1)(B).
438Federal Communications Commission DA 23-68
the Act authorizes us to assess a forfeiture against a service provider such as Pacific of up to $237,268 for 
each violation or each day of a continuing violation, up to a statutory maximum of $2,372,677 for a single 
act or failure to act.42  In exercising our forfeiture authority, we must consider the “nature, circumstances, 
extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the violator, the degree of culpability, any history 
of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as justice may require.”43  In addition, the 
Commission has established forfeiture guidelines that establish base penalties for certain violations and 
identify criteria to consider when determining the appropriate penalty in any given case.44  
13. The Commission may adopt upward or downward adjustments to forfeitures when 
appropriate.45  Under section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules, we may adjust a forfeiture upward for 
egregious misconduct, ability to pay and relative disincentive, an intentional violation, substantial harm, 
prior violations of Commission requirements, substantial economic gain, or repeated or continuous 
violations.46  We may adjust a forfeiture downward for a minor violation, good faith or voluntary 
disclosure, a history of overall compliance, or an inability to pay.47  The forfeiture guidelines listed in 
section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules specifically “are intended as a guide for frequently recurring 
violations” and not “a complete or exhaustive list of violations.”48  
14. Section 312(f)(1) of the Act defines “willful” as the “conscious and deliberate 
commission or omission of [any] act, irrespective of any intent to violate” the law.49  The legislative 
history to section 312(f)(1) of the Act clarifies that this definition of willful applies to both sections 312 
and 503(b) of the Act,50 and the Commission has so interpreted the term in the section 503(b) context.51  
We therefore find that the Company’s failures to file a total of 13 Worksheets required between August 1, 
2019, and, February 1, 2022, were willful.  Given that the Company failed to file 13 Worksheets between 
August 1, 2019, and, February 1, 2022, we also find that the Company’s apparent filing violations were 
42 See 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)(2)(B); 47 CFR § 1.80(b)(2).  These amounts reflect inflation adjustments to the forfeitures 
specified in section 503(b)(2)(B) of the Act ($100,000 per violation or per day of a continuing violation and a 
statutory maximum of $1,000,000 for a single act or failure to act).  See Amendment of Section 1.80(b) of the 
Commission’s Rules, Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inflation, Order, DA 22-1356 (EB Dec. 23, 
2022); see also Annual Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inflation, 88 Fed. Reg. 783 (Jan. 5, 2023)

repeated.52  Section 503(b)(6)(B) of the Act provides that no forfeiture penalty shall be imposed if “the 
violation charged occurred more than one year prior to the date of issuance of the required notice or 
notice of apparent liability.”53  We therefore propose a forfeiture for the Company’s failure to file its 
Quarterly Worksheet due on February 1, 2022.    
15. Section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules specifies a base forfeiture of $3,000 for failure to 
file required forms or information.54  Given the importance of the Worksheet filing requirements, the 
Commission has consistently applied an upward adjustment and proposed a forfeiture of $50,000 for each 
failure of a service provider to file timely or accurate Worksheets.55  However, given the accumulating 
record of non-compliance with the requirements to file accurate Worksheets by each filing deadline, 
service providers failing to comply with these requirements have been provided notice that the 
Commission could impose substantially higher upward adjustments for prior violations and for repeated 
or continuous violations.56  Enforcement actions for the failure to file timely or accurate Worksheets can 
include upward adjustments up to the statutory maximum forfeiture authorized under section 503(b)(2) of 
the Act.57
16. In assessing a forfeiture amount, we consider the nature, extent, and gravity of the failure 
to comply with the Worksheet filing requirements to be very serious.58  The Commission, USAC, and the 
administrators of the TRS Fund, LNP, and NANP rely on the data reported in Worksheets to determine 
respectively the accurate amounts that service providers owe for regulatory fees, the USF, and these other 
important funding mechanisms arising under the Act.59  When a service provider fails to report its 
revenues accurately in its Worksheets by each filing deadline, the service provider could prevent the USF, 
TRS, LNP and NANP administrators and the Commission from fully invoicing the service provider for 
federal payment obligations implemented under the Act.60  Pacific’s failure to file its Worksheets between 
August 1, 2019, and, February 1, 2022, had serious implications for the administration of these funding 
mechanisms.  The Commission and the administrators acting on its behalf to assess accurate regulatory 
fees, and contributions for the USF, TRS Fund, LNP, and NANP, depend on every service provider’s 
compliance with the periodic Worksheet filing requirements.  A service provider’s failure to file its 
Worksheets impedes the Congressional mandate that each service provider contribute on an equitable and 
52 Under the Act, 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)(1)(B), any service provider that “willfully or repeatedly” fails to comply with 
provisions of the Act or Commission rules or orders issued pursuant to the Act shall be liable for a forfeiture 
penalty.

nondiscriminatory basis to the USF,61 and to these other important funding mechanisms arising under the 
Act.  We have also considered the degree of the Company’s culpability and repeated violations.62  The 
Company has an important obligation to file accurate Worksheets by the filing deadlines every year, and 
Pacific has apparently failed to comply for nearly three years.  The Company is thus highly culpable for 
its repeated filing failures.  
17. Section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules provides for an upward adjustment to forfeiture 
amounts for prior violations of any FCC requirements and for repeated or continuous violations.63  
Consistent with Commission precedent,64 we apply an upward adjustment for the repeated nature of the 
Company’s violations, including the Company’s failures to file a total of 13 Worksheets between August 
1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.65  We thus apply an upward adjustment to the base forfeiture that not only 
reflects the extent and gravity of the violation, and the substantial harm to federal cost recovery 
requirements by not filing Worksheets,66 but also reflects the repeated violations in this case.67  We thus 
propose a total forfeiture of $100,000.
18. Consistent with the Act and the Commission’s rules,68 we have exercised our discretion 
and considered the specific circumstances related to the Company and the violations it apparently 
committed, and we therefore find the Company apparently liable for a total proposed forfeiture of one 
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for willfully and repeatedly failing to comply with the 
Commission’s Worksheet filing requirements.69
V. CONCLUSION
19. We have determined that Pacific apparently violated sections 52.17(b), 52.32(b), 
54.711(a), and 64.604(c)(5)(iii)(B) of the Commission’s rules and Commission orders by willfully and 
repeatedly failing to file its Worksheets between August 1, 2019, and February 1, 2022.70  We therefore 
find that Pacific is apparently liable for a forfeiture of $100,000.

BROADBAND DATA TASK FORCE ANNOUNCES RECOMMENDED BEST 
PRACTICES FOR CHALLENGES TO UPDATED BROADBAND SERVICEABLE 
LOCATION FABRIC
WC Docket Nos. 11-10 and 19-195
By this Public Notice, the Broadband Data Task Force (Task Force) announces recommended 
best practices for submitting bulk challenges to the most recent version of the Broadband Serviceable 
Location Fabric (Fabric) data.  The Task Force also provides notice that bulk Fabric challenges submitted 
as much in advance of March 15, 2023, as possible are most likely to be reviewed and adjudicated in 
time to be accounted for in the next iteration of the Fabric (version three) to be released in conjunction 
with the Broadband Data Collection (BDC) filing window for data as of June 30, 2023 that is due no later 
than September 1, 2023.  Bulk Fabric challenges submitted after March 15, 2023, will still be accepted 
and reviewed on a rolling basis, however, they would likely be adjudicated as part of a future version of 
the Fabric.1  
On December 27, 2022, the Task Force announced that an updated version of the Fabric (version 
two) would be made available in conjunction with the opening of the BDC filing window on January 3, 
2023.2  Fabric data is associated with a relevant “as-of” date for fixed broadband availability data 
reporting, and we therefore release each updated iteration of Fabric data in conjunction with the opening 
of a BDC filing window for reporting broadband availability as-of June 30 or December 31 of each year.  
Version two of the Fabric data serves as the foundation upon which fixed broadband availability data as 
of December 31, 2022, must be reported no later than March 1, 2023.3 
1 NTIA, under its authority under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, continues “to target June 30 as the date by 
which [it] will allocate each state and territory’s BEAD Program funding for high-speed Internet service.” 
https://ntia.gov/blog/2023/advancing-internet-all.  The Commission continues to accept challenges to the Fabric and 
broadband availability data on a rolling basis as contemplated by the Broadband DATA Act, the Commission’s 
rules, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  See Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technology Availability 
Act, Pub. L. No. 116-130, §802(b)(5)(C), 134 Stat. 228 (2020) (codified at 47 U.S.C. § 642(b)(5)(C)); 47 CFR § 
1.7006(d); Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-58, § 60102(h)(2)(E)(i), 135 Stat. 429 (2021) 
(codified at 47 U.S.C. § 642(b)(5)(C)(i)).  The results of availability challenges will be updated on the National 
Broadband Map (NBM) as soon as they are resolved.  The results of location challenges to Fabric version two are 
expected to be reflected in the Map by November 2023.
2 Broadband Data Task Force Announces Opening of the Second Broadband Data Collection Filing Window, WC 
Docket Nos. 19-195, 11-10, Public Notice, DA 22-1372 (WTB/WCB/OEA Dec. 27, 2022).  Version two of the 
Fabric contains data from additional data sources and other improvements by the FCC and CostQuest, as well as the 
results of bulk Fabric challenges submitted by state and local governments and broadband providers on or before 
November 10, 2022.  
3 The FCC will publish the December 31, 2022 broadband availability data, reported and overlaid on to version two 
of the Fabric, in an update to the NBM in the spring.   
445Federal Communications Commission DA 23-69
As of January 3, 2023, the BDC system only accepts bulk Fabric challenges based upon the data 
in version two of the Fabric.4  Any bulk challenges to version one of the Fabric that were filed between 
November 11, 2022, and January 2, 2023, are being “carried over” and reviewed and adjudicated against 
version two, and therefore do not need to be refiled; bulk challenges submitted on or after January 3, 2023 
however, must be submitted against version two of the Fabric.
Bulk Fabric challengers should submit their challenges to version two of the Fabric as soon as 
possible and, in any case, no later than March 15, 2023, to have the best opportunity to be considered in 
time for preparation of the next version of the Fabric (version three).  Bulk Fabric challenges submitted 
after March 15, 2023, are unlikely to be considered for version three of the Fabric and will instead be 
reviewed and adjudicated as part of a future iteration of the Fabric.  
Based on our review of the bulk challenges submitted to version one of the Fabric, we reiterate 
here some of our guidance to assist filers with reviewing Fabric data to assure that filers do not submit 
challenges seeking to add locations that are already reflected in the Fabric (i.e., “Type 1” Fabric 
challenges).  As we have previously emphasized, the Fabric is a dataset created by analyzing numerous 
input data sources to derive geographic coordinates for building footprints (i.e., structures) that the FCC 
has determined are broadband serviceable locations (BSLs).  It is therefore important to reiterate that the 
Fabric is not a database of addresses, and that address data, while included in the Fabric where available, 
are an unreliable determinant of the precise geographic coordinates of structures where broadband service 
can be installed.  
Preparing a bulk Fabric challenge is fundamentally a geospatial process.  Entities therefore should 
not attempt to upload as a bulk Fabric challenge a list of addresses they have compiled for another 
purpose (e.g., a list of addresses from a billing system or from an E911 database), though these datasets 
can serve as a helpful starting point for producing a valid bulk Fabric challenge.  As an initial step, 
challengers can attempt to join this type of address-based data to the address information included in the 
Fabric in order to associate unique Fabric location IDs with the locations in the prospective challenger’s 
data.5  But the challenger should not simply upload as a challenge all of the data it is unable to match to 
an existing location ID using an address matching join.  In other words, the fact that an address is missing 
from the Fabric does not necessarily indicate that the location is missing from the Fabric.6  
4 The Fabric data currently displayed on the NBM are version one data, which form the foundation upon which ISPs 
reported their service availability as of June 30, 2022.  Individuals submitting location challenges from the NBM 
will continue to submit challenges to those Fabric data.  See FCC, Which Version of the Fabric Should I Use? (Jan. 
3, 2023), https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/11749189297947-Which-Version-of-the-Fabric-Should-I-Use-  
(“[i]ndividual challenges to both location and availability data, which are submitted directly using the National 
Broadband Map challenge interface, will also continue to be based on [version one] of the Fabric until the December 
31, 2022, availability data are published.”).  Individual challenges from the NBM will be reviewed and aligned with 
updates CostQuest has made in version two of the Fabric and bulk challenges to version two data.  
5 We have previously provided guidance on how to perform this joining process, including tools for attempted 
“fuzzy matching” of addresses.  FCC, Broadband Serviceable Location Fabric Overview for Fixed Availability Data 
Filers (Sept. 28, 2022), https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/7780065291291-Video-Broadband-Serviceable-

6 We remind challengers that the Commission treats multi-tenant environments as single BSLs in the Broadband 
Data Collection.  Establishing the Digital Opportunity Data Collection; Modernizing the FCC Form 477 Data 
Program, WC Docket Nos. 19-195, 11-10, Third Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd 1126, 1177, para. 130 (2021).  
Accordingly, challengers should not seek to add additional units as BSLs.  See FCC, Fabric FAQs (Jan. 10, 2023), 
https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/7412732399003-Fabric-FAQs (“[i]n the case of multiple housing units 
within a single structure on a single parcel, the location will have a single entry or record in the Fabric that 
corresponds to a set of coordinates within the structure.”); FCC, Bulk Fabric Challenge FAQs (Dec. 6, 2022),

Rather than simply filing a Type 1 challenge consisting of a list of addresses, the challenger 
should next proceed to a geospatial analysis of both its address data and the data included in the Fabric.  
The challenger should start by loading the Fabric data into a geospatial analysis tool.7  Loading additional 
datasets—including not only datasets such as billing system data and E911 data, but also additional 
datasets, such as building footprint imagery data and road data—will allow filers to improve the quality of 
any challenges.8  After uploading their data sources, filers should undertake a geospatial process to 
eliminate locations from a challenge that are likely already designated as BSLs in version two of the 
Fabric and focus on the remaining locations.  For example, filers should eliminate any points that fall 
within a set buffer distance of an existing location point in the version two Fabric data.9  Filers should 
also eliminate any location data that falls on a road or that that falls outside of a building footprint.10  
They can then perform a more detailed review of the remaining points to determine whether a Fabric 
challenge is warranted (and, if so, what category of challenge should be submitted).  For any locations 
included in the challenger’s data that are not included in the version two Fabric data, filers should format 
challenges as a .csv file.  Importantly, when including address information with a bulk Fabric challenge 
(either as a Type 1 challenge to add a BSL or a Type 2 challenge to change the address data for an 
existing Fabric location), filers will also need to run their address information through USPS CASS 
validation to ensure the challenge is not rejected through the FCC’s review process.11  
As a reminder, entities that had previously entered into a license agreement with CostQuest 
received an email from CostQuest on or around December 30, 2022, providing them with a link to 
download version two Fabric data in their covered areas.12  Entities that have not yet entered into a license 
agreement with CostQuest for Fabric data (including internet service providers, state, local or Tribal 
governmental entities, or other entities wishing to use the Fabric data for purposes of participating in the 
BDC) may do so by following the instructions the Task Force has provided for obtaining access to the 
Fabric.13  
address for an individual unit or substructure that is part of a larger building, such as a condo or apartment, that is 
already identified as a BSL in the Fabric.  If you drop the unit/apartment number from your address and the 
remaining part of the address (the street number and street name) matches to a location in the Fabric, there is no 
need to file a challenge.”).

9 If your data for a location did not match to an existing location ID in the Fabric through your address matching 
process but is in close geographic proximity to an existing BSL point in the Fabric, then you may still want to 
submit a Fabric challenge.  But the category of the challenge may be to, e.g., change the address for the location, 
rather than to add a BSL to the Fabric.  
10 Geographic coordinates for a Fabric challenge point must fall within a building footprint in order to be upheld as a 
successful Fabric challenge.  As a result, if a set of geographic coordinates submitted by a challenger either falls in 
the middle of a road or otherwise falls outside of a building footprint, then the challenge is likely to be rejected.

ORDER
Adopted:  January 25, 2023 Released:  January 25, 2023
By the Acting Chief, Consumer Policy Division, Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau:
1. In this Order, we consider a complaint alleging that Clear Rate Communications (Clear 
Rate) changed Complainant’s telecommunications service provider without obtaining authorization and 
verification from Complainant as required by the Commission’s rules.1  We conclude that Clear Rate’s 
actions violated the Commission’s slamming rules, and we therefore grant Complainant’s complaint.
2. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), prohibits the 
practice of “slamming,” the submission or execution of an unauthorized change in a subscriber’s selection 
of a provider of telephone exchange service or telephone toll service.2  The Commission’s implementing 
rules require, among other things, that a carrier receive individual subscriber consent before a carrier 
change may occur.3  Specifically, a carrier must: (1) obtain the subscriber’s written or electronically 
signed authorization in a format that satisfies our rules; (2) obtain confirmation from the subscriber via a 
toll-free number provided exclusively for the purpose of confirming orders electronically; or (3) utilize an 
appropriately qualified independent third party to verify the order.4  The Commission has also adopted 
rules to limit the liability of subscribers when an unauthorized carrier change occurs, and to require 
carriers involved in slamming practices to compensate subscribers whose carriers were changed without 
authorization.5  
3. The Commission’s slamming rules prohibit misrepresentations on sales calls to further 
reduce the incidence of slamming.6  Under the rules, upon a finding of material misrepresentation during

2 47 U.S.C. § 258(a).
3 See 47 CFR § 64.1120.
4 See id. § 64.1120(c).  Section 64.1130 details the requirements for letter of agency form and content for written or 
electronically signed authorizations.  Id. § 64.1130.
5 These rules require the unauthorized carrier to absolve the subscriber where the subscriber has not paid his or her 
bill.  If the subscriber has not already paid charges to the unauthorized carrier, the subscriber is absolved of liability 
for charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier for service provided during the first 30 days after the unauthorized 
change.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1160.  Any charges imposed by the unauthorized carrier on the subscriber for service 
provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by the subscriber to the authorized carrier at the rates the subscriber 
was paying to the authorized carrier at the time of the unauthorized change.  Id.  Where the subscriber has paid 
charges to the unauthorized carrier, the Commission’s rules require that the unauthorized carrier pay 150 percent of 
those charges to the authorized carrier, and the authorized carrier shall refund or credit to the subscriber 50 percent 
of all charges paid by the subscriber to the unauthorized carrier.  See id. §§ 64.1140, 64.1170.

the sales call, the consumer’s authorization to change carriers will be deemed invalid even if the carrier 
has some evidence of consumer authorization of a carrier switch, e.g., a third-party verification (TPV) 
recording.  Sales misrepresentations may not be cured by a facially valid TPV.7  The rule provides that a 
consumer’s credible allegation of misrepresentation shifts the burden of proof to the carrier to provide 
evidence to rebut the consumer’s claim regarding misrepresentation.  The Commission made clear that an 
accurate and complete recording of the sales call may be the carrier’s best persuasive evidence to rebut 
the consumer’s claim that a misrepresentation was made on the sales call.8
4. We received Complainant’s complaint alleging that Complainant’s telecommunications 
service provider had been changed without Complainant’s authorization.9  In the complaint, Complainant 
also alleges that Clear Rate’s telemarketer “convinced her [aunt] without her understanding to change her 
Verizon service that she has had for more than 30 years to their service.”10  
5. Pursuant to our rules, we notified Clear Rate of the complaint.11  Clear Rate responded, 
stating that the Complainant agreed to and authorized the carrier switch.12  It also provided two audio 
recordings—a third party verification recording (TPV) and a recording Clear Rate characterized as a 
“quality assurance call.”13  Clear Rate did not provide a recording of the sales call or any other evidence 
related to the sales call.
6. The Division thoroughly reviewed all the evidence provided by both the Complainant and 
Clear Rate.  Based on the evidence in the record, we find Complainant’s allegation of a sales call 
misrepresentation to be credible.  We further find that Clear Rate has failed to provide persuasive 
evidence to rebut Complainant’s misrepresentation claim and therefore that Complainant’s authorization 
to change carriers is invalid.  As the Commission stated in the 2018 Slamming Order, “[w]hen a 
consumer’s decision to switch carriers is predicated on false information provided in a sales call, that 
consumer’s authorization to switch carriers can no longer be considered binding.”14  We therefore find 
that Clear Rate’s actions resulted in an unauthorized change in Complainant’s telecommunications service

5773, 5778-80, paras. 17-19 (2018) (2018 Slamming Order); 47 CFR § 64.1120(a)(1)(i)(A).  
8 See 2018 Slamming Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 5781, para. 23.  The Commission also stated that a carrier is uniquely 
positioned via its access to sales scripts, recordings, training, and other relevant materials relating to sales calls to 
proffer evidence to rebut a consumer’s claims.  Id.
9 See Informal Complaint No. 5925469.
10 Id.  Complainant also stated that Clear Rate “had her aunt’s phone service turned off, so she went weeks with no 
landline, and she has a Pace Maker attached to [the] phone service.  It took many hours and lots of trouble to get 
Verizon to get her service back.”  Id. 
11 47 CFR § 1.719 (Commission procedure for informal complaints filed pursuant to section 258 of the Act); id. § 
64.1150 (procedures for resolution of unauthorized changes in preferred carrier).  In the notification, we directed 
Clear Rate to respond to the specific misrepresentation allegation and to provide any evidence to rebut it.   
12 See Clear Rate Response to Informal Complaint No. 5925469 (filed Jan. 18, 2023) (Clear Rate Response); see 
also 47 CFR § 64.1160.    
13 We note that on the TPV recording provided by Clear Rate, the third-party verifier repeats the same question 
several times, even after the Complainant responds “no,” until the verifier receives a “yes” response.

TPV calls did not cure those misrepresentations)).

provider, as defined by the rules, and we discuss Clear Rate’s liability below.15      
7. Clear Rate must remove all charges incurred for service provided to Complainant for the 
first thirty days after the alleged unauthorized change in accordance with the Commission’s liability 
rules.16  We have determined that Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the 
first thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that neither the Complainant’s authorized 
carrier nor Clear Rate may pursue any collection against Complainant for those charges.17  Any charges 
imposed by Clear Rate on the Complainant for service provided after this 30-day period shall be paid by 
the Complainant to the authorized carrier at the rates the Complainant was paying the authorized carrier at 
the time of the unauthorized change of their telecommunications service provider.18
8. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 258 of the Communications Act 
of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. § 258, and sections 0.141, 0.361, and 1.719 of the Commission’s rules, 
47 CFR §§ 0.141, 0.361, 1.719, the complaint filed against Clear Rate Communications IS GRANTED.
9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to section 64.1170(d) of the Commission’s 
rules, 47 CFR § 64.1170(d), Complainant is entitled to absolution for the charges incurred during the first 
thirty days after the unauthorized change occurred and that Clear Rate Communications may not pursue 
any collection against Complainant for those charges.
10. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order is effective upon release.

AUDIO DIVISION ANNOUNCES AVAILABILITY OF 2020 DECENNIAL CENSUS DATA
The Audio Division, Media Bureau announces the availability of the most recent 2020 U.S. Census 
Bureau (U.S. Census) decennial census block, population, and cartographic boundary data.  The U.S. 
Census releases census block, population and cartographic boundary data following each decennial 
census.  Effective April 1, 2023, petitioners/applicants submitting filings to the Audio Division1 must 
employ the most recent 2020 U.S. Census data available when determining a particular community’s 
population in addition to the population served and overlap of service areas to communities and 
Urbanized Areas.2 
In the 2010 U.S. Census, “Urbanized Areas” are defined as a subset of urban areas that contain 50,000 or 
more people whereas “Urban Clusters” are defined as urban areas that have a population of at least 2,500 
people and less than 50,000 people.  In the 2020 U.S. Census, the distinction between "Urbanized Areas" 
and "Urban Clusters" are eliminated.  Each user must define thresholds within the urban areas for its own 
purposes.3  Accordingly, we will continue to define an “Urbanized Area” as an urban area that contains 
50,000 or more people.  In the 2020 U.S. Census, there are 511 such “Urbanized Areas,” which is a net 
increase of 12 from the 499 “Urbanized Areas” in the 2010 Census.  TIGER Shapefiles for census blocks, 
community boundaries, and urban areas are now all available for download from the Census Bureau at 
https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER_RD18/LAYER.4 
For additional information, please contact John Gabrysch ( John.Gabrysch@fcc.gov), Rolanda F. Smith,

UPDATED TOWER CONSTRUCTION GUIDANCE FOLLOWING THE DELAY IN 
THE RECLASSIFICATION OF THE NORTHERN LONG-EARED BAT AS 
ENDANGERED UNDER THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT
On January 24, 2023, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal 
Communications Commission (Commission) issued updated instructions to the tower industry for 
considering the potential effects that proposed facilities could have in the northern long-eared bat’s 
(Myotis septentrionalis) range as part of an applicant’s environmental review.1  On November 29, 2022, 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announced a final rule to reclassify the northern long-eared 
bat from being listed as threatened to being listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species 
Act (ESA), effective January 30, 2023.2  On January 26, 2023, the Service announced that it is delaying 
the effective date of the final rule to March 31, 2023.3  The Service stated that delaying the effective 
date’s implementation will allow the Service to “finalize conservation tools and guidance documents, 
thereby preventing confusion and disruption with other Federal agencies under section 7 of the Act.”4  
With this guidance, the Commission informs applicants of this delay in the effective date of the 
Service’s final rule.  In light of this delay, and until the Service’s final rule becomes effective, applicants 
should continue to follow the Commission’s prior guidance for protection of the northern long-eared bat 
issued on December 2, 2021.5  When the Service’s final rule becomes effective, we direct applicants to 
consult with the Service’s resources6 and the applicant’s respective field Service office7 to determine how 
to proceed with the consultation process for projects that are proposed or in pre-construction status as of 
that date.

WIRELINE COMPETITION BUREAU RELEASES RESULTS OF TESTS REQUIRED BY 
SECTIONS 61.50(j) AND 69.803(c) OF THE COMMISSION’S RULES
WC Docket Nos. 21-17 and 17-144
By this Public Notice, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) complies with the obligations 
imposed by the Commission’s rules and publicly releases the updated results of the tests the Bureau is 
required to perform every three years, pursuant to sections 61.50(j) and 69.803(c) of the Commission’s 
rules.1  These results are based on the Commission’s most recent, publicly-available, Form 477 data and 
further supplement the previous lists the Bureau has released in compliance with the above-referenced 
rules.  The results of the Bureau’s analysis are attached to this Public Notice as Appendices A and B.  The 
second supplemental lists, as well as the previous lists from 2017, 2018 and 2020, are available at: 
https://www.fcc.gov/general/bds-competitive-and-noncompetitive-lists.2    
On May 15, 2017, the Bureau announced the public release of a list of counties served in part or 
in whole by price cap carriers (price-cap counties) that were deemed competitive, non-competitive, or 
grandfathered pursuant to the initial competitive market test adopted in the Price Cap BDS Order.3  The

WC Docket Nos. 16-143, 05-25, and RM-10593, and opened WC Docket No. 21-17 for price cap business data 
services (BDS) issues.  See Wireline Competition Bureau Terminates Price Cap Data Services Proceedings, Closes

2 FCC, BDS Competitive and Noncompetitive Lists (Jan. 27, 2023), https://www.fcc.gov/bds-competitive-and-

public notice listing newly competitive counties for price cap carriers and study areas for rate-of-return carriers and 
also provide this information on the Commission’s website.  Price Cap BDS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 3528, para. 151,

3 Wireline Competition Bureau Publicly Releases Lists of Counties Where Lower Speed TDM-Based Business Data 
Services Are Deemed Competitive, Non-Competitive, or Grandfathered, WC Docket Nos. 16-143 et al., Public 
Notice, 32 FCC Rcd 3966, 3966 (WCB 2017) (2017 County List Public Notice).  A county was deemed competitive 
in the initial price cap test if either: (1) 50% of locations with BDS demand within the county were within a half 
mile of a location served by a competitive provider based on data from the 2015 special access data collection; or (2) 
75% of the census blocks within the county had access to broadband from a cable operator, based on Form 477 data 
as of December 2016.  47 CFR § 69.803(b)(1).  A grandfathered market is a “county that does not satisfy the 
competitive market test set forth in § 69.803 for which a price cap carrier obtained Phase II relief pursuant to § 
69.711(c)” prior to June 2017.  47 CFR §§ 69.801(e), 69.807(a).    
457Federal Communications Commission DA 23-76
initial price-cap test results were based on data from the 2015 special access data collection and Form 477 
data, as of December 31, 2016.4  
On October 25, 2018, the Bureau released a list of study areas served by rate-of-return carriers 
(rate-of-return study areas) receiving fixed universal service support that were deemed competitive 
pursuant to the competitive market test adopted in the Rate-of-Return BDS Order.5  The initial rate-of-
return test results were based on Form 477 data, as of June 30, 2017.6  Rate-of-return carriers electing 
incentive regulation for their business data service (BDS) offerings serving competitive study areas and 
price cap carriers serving competitive counties were granted relief from ex ante pricing regulation and 
tariffing obligations for time division multiplexing (TDM)-based end-user channel terminations with 
capacity at or below a DS3.7  
The Commission directed the Bureau to update the results of both tests every three years, based 
on the most recent Form 477 broadband availability data submitted by cable operators.8  For the price-cap 
update, the Commission directed the Bureau to use a modified version of the initial price-cap test based 
on updated Form 477 data.  Under the subsequent price-cap test, a county is deemed competitive if a 
cable operator reports that 75% of the census blocks within the county have broadband availability.9  The 
Commission also directed the Bureau to re-run the rate-of-return test using updated Form 477 data.10  
Under the rate-of-return test, a study area is deemed competitive if 75% of the census blocks within the 
study area are served by a cable operator offering a minimum of 10 Mbps downstream/1 Mbps upstream 
broadband service.11     
The Commission directed the Bureau to update the price-cap and rate-of-return test results every 
three years, following the 2020 price cap test, using Form 477 data as of the date of the most recent 
4 47 CFR § 69.803(b)(1).  Pursuant to the initial price-cap market test, 1,879 counties were deemed competitive, 
1,276 counties were deemed non-competitive, and 69 counties were in grandfathered markets.  BDS Competitive

5 Wireline Competition Bureau Publicly Releases List of Study Areas Deemed Competitive If Rate-of-Return 
Carriers Elect Incentive Regulation For Those Areas, WC Docket No. 17-144 et al., Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd 
10169 (WCB 2018) (2018 County List Public Notice).  A study area is deemed competitive in the rate-of-return test 
if 75% of the census blocks within the study area are served by a cable operator offering a minimum of 10/1 Mbps 
broadband service based on Form 477 data.  47 CFR § 61.50(j)(1).
6 2018 County Public Notice, 33 FCC Rcd at 10169.  Pursuant to the initial application of the rate-of-return test, the 
Bureau deemed 16 rate-of-return study areas receiving fixed universal service support to be competitive.  BDS

Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 3528, para. 151.  
9 47 CFR § 69.803(c)(2); Price Cap BDS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 3527-29, paras. 145-152.  As with the initial price 
cap test, the Bureau used cable broadband connections with a minimum 10/1 Mbps capacity to assess competition. 
10 Rate-of-Return BDS Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 10439-40, para. 104.
11 47 CFR § 61.50(j)(1)-(2); Rate-of-Return BDS Order, 33 FCC Rcd at 10439-40, paras. 103-104. Given the high 
sunk costs involved in network deployment, the Commission determined that once a price-cap county or rate-of-
return study area is deemed competitive, it would retain its competitive status and not be retested.  47 CFR §§ 
61.50(j)(3), 69.803(c)(3); see Price Cap BDS Order, 32 FCC Rcd at 3528-29, para. 152; Rate-of-Return BDS Order,

collection.12  The Bureau now updates the results of both tests using Form 477 data reflecting the 
availability of broadband service from cable operators as of December 31, 2021.13  Based on these data, 
the Bureau, in coordination with the Office of Economics and Analytics, tested price-cap counties that 
were previously deemed to be non-competitive and retested rate-of-return study areas receiving fixed 
universal service support that were previously deemed not to be competitive.14  The Bureau found that 15 
price-cap counties that were previously deemed non-competitive now meet the competitive threshold 
established by the Commission’s rules.  The price cap-served areas within those counties are therefore 
deemed competitive, effective immediately.15  The Bureau also found that five additional rate-of-return 
study areas receiving fixed universal service support meet the applicable threshold and are therefore 
deemed competitive, also effective immediately.16  
The lists of price-cap counties and rate-of-return study areas newly deemed competitive pursuant 
to the updated test results are attached as Appendices A and B, respectively.  Parties wishing to challenge 
these updated test results may file a petition for reconsideration with the Bureau or an application for 
review with the Commission.17  Pending any challenges to these results, the newly deemed-competitive 
price-cap counties and rate-of-return study areas will not be retested in subsequent three-year updates.18  
These lists supplement the lists of price-cap counties and rate-of-return study areas deemed competitive 
pursuant to the initial and first supplemental competitive market tests which are also available on the 
Commission’s website.19

MEDIA BUREAU ANNOUNCES FURTHER EXTENSION OF TIME FOR ENTITIES 
TO FILE DOCUMENTS INTO THEIR ONLINE PUBLIC INSPECTION FILES AND 
TO FILE CHILDREN’S PROGRAMMING REPORTS AND TELEVISION LICENSE 
RENEWAL APPLICATIONS
On January 6, 2023, the Media Bureau announced an extension of time for filings 
required to be uploaded into the Commission’s Online Public Inspection File (OPIF) system.1  
As a result of ongoing technical issues adversely affecting the responsiveness of the OPIF and 
Licensing Management System (LMS), we further extend the deadline by which all broadcast, 
cable, and satellite entities must upload required documents into their OPIF, and extend the 
deadline for the Form 2100, Schedule H Annual Children’s Programming Report and Form 
2100, Schedule 303S, Renewal of Broadcast Station License.  All of these documents that were 
due to be placed in an entity’s OPIF or filed through LMS since January 1, 2023, must be filed 
no later than February 28, 2023.2  Extending these filing deadlines will not significantly impact 
the public’s or the Bureau’s review of a licensee’s compliance with the Commission’s rules.  
While we are extending OPIF and LMS filing deadlines, we encourage licensees to file all 
documents as soon as practicable.

Petition to Deny
Dear Counsel and Applicants:
We have before us six mutually exclusive applications filed by Elijah Radio (Elijah), Big Bend 
Heritage Music Association, Inc. (Big Bend), Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission (GPTC), 
Faith and Action Community Outreach, Inc. (Faith), Church Planters of America (Church Planters) and 
Bemiss Road Baptist Church and Lowndes County Christian Academy Inc. (Bemiss) for construction 
469permits for new noncommercial educational (NCE) FM stations in communities in Florida and Georgia,1 
which the Media Bureau (Bureau) designated as NCE MX Group 59B.2  On January 23, 2023, the Bureau 
rescinded its tentative selection of the Big Bend Application and identified the Elijah Application as the 
new tentative selectee of the group.3  We also have before us a petition to deny the Big Bend Application 
filed by GPTC, which the Bureau did not review prior to release of the NCE MX Group 59B Order.4  For 
the reasons set forth below, on our own motion,5 we rescind in part the NCE MX Group 59B Order, 
rescind our tentative selection of the Elijah Application, dismiss the GPTC Petition as moot, and refer 
NCE MX Group 59B to the Commission to conduct a point system analysis.6 
Background.  The subject applications were filed during the November 2021, NCE FM filing 
window..7  Group 59B originally included two additional applicants, CSN International (CSN) and 
Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. (Inverse).8  The Bureau initially performed a fair distribution analysis of the 
eight applications and identified Inverse as the tentative selectee in Group 59B.9  Inverse and CSN, 
however, subsequently requested dismissal of their applications.  Accordingly, the Bureau conducted a 
second 307(b) analysis and identified Big Bend as the new tentative selectee of this group.10  However, 
Big Bend subsequently filed an amendment to its application in which it revised its population data and 
certified that it was not eligible for a fair distribution preference.11 
1 Application File Nos. 0000167410 (Elijah Application); 0000166291 (Big Bend Application); 0000167018 (GPTC 
Application); 0000165985 (Faith Application); 0000167096 (Church Planters Application); 0000167233 (Bemiss 
Application).

Window for New Noncommercial Education Stations; Opens Window to Accept Settlements and Technical 
Amendments, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, DA 21-1476 (MB Nov. 29, 2021).  Group 59, which originally 
contained 17 applications, was bifurcated as a result of a technical amendment.

Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 23-59 (MB Jan. 23, 2023) (NCE

4 Pleading File No. 0000204974 (filed Dec. 9, 2022) (GPTC Petition).  Big Bend did not file an opposition to this 
pleading.
5 See 47 CFR § 1.108 (Commission may, on its own motion, reconsider any action within 30 days).  
6 See 47 CFR § 73.7002(b).  The point system analysis, conducted when the section 307(b) analysis is not 
determinative, is considered a simplified “hearing” for purposes of 47 U.S.C. § 155(c)(1).  See Reexamination of the 
Comparative Standards for Noncommercial Educational Applicants, Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd 7386, 7420 
(2001) (NCE Order).

10 Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 5 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct 
New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-1166, at 4-5, para. 10 
(MB Nov. 9, 2022) (November 2022 Fair Distribution Order).
11 See Big Bend Application, Fair Distribution of Service Section and Attach. “Perry 210 Amendment Purpose.pdf” 
(filed Dec. 7, 2022).  
470Discussion.  In the NCE MX Group 59B Order, the Bureau rescinded the tentative selection of 
Big Bend and conducted a third 307(b) analysis and identified Elijah as the tentative selectee of this 
group.12  However, upon release of the Order, counsel for GPTC informed the Bureau that the staff 
neglected to address the GPTC Petition.13  Although the GPTC Petition primarily argues that the tentative 
selection of Big Bend should be rescinded, the petition also noted that the November 2022 Fair 
Distribution Order relied on the incorrect fair distribution exhibit when analyzing the Elijah Application, 
specifically relying on the exhibit provided in the original application instead of the revised exhibit in the 
application as amended on January 28, 2022.14  The NCE MX Group 59B Order also mistakenly relied on 
Elijah’s original fair distribution exhibit instead of its revised exhibit.  Accordingly, we rescind the NCE 
Group MX 59B Order to the extent it identified the Elijah Application as the new tentative selectee of 
NCE MX Group 59B and conduct a new fair distribution analysis considering Elijah’s revised fair 
distribution exhibit.15 
Elijah and GPTC each claims that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference based on 
combined first and second NCE population totals.16  The other applicants do not.  Accordingly, Big Bend, 
Faith, Church Planters, and Bemiss are each eliminated.  Elijah would provide a combined first and 
second NCE service to 2,149 people; and GPTC to 6,971 people.  The proposals are comparable because 
neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people.17  Thus, we are unable to designate a tentative selectee 
under a 307(b) fair distribution analysis, and GPTC and Elijah will proceed to a point system analysis.
The point system analysis, which is conducted when section 307(b) is not determinative, must be 
conducted by the Commission, as this analysis is considered a simplified “hearing” for purposes of 
section 155(c)(1) of the Act.18  Accordingly we have referred the matter to the Commission to make a 
determination under a point system analysis.19 
12 NCE MX Group 59B Order at 4, para. 10.
13 Email from Margaret L. Miller, Counsel for GPTC, to Albert Shuldiner, Chief, Audio Division (January 23, 
2023).
14 GPTC Petition at 2-3, n. 4.  See also Elijah Application at Attachs. “1st  & 2nd NCE Service, rev 1.pdf” (original 
fair distribution attachment) and “Engineering Exhibits for 767346 Amendment.pdf” (revised fair distribution 
attachment filed on January 28, 2022).
15 An applicant's fair distribution showing must be computed as of the time of filing and cannot be enhanced 
thereafter. See 47 CFR § 73.7003(e) and (f)(3).  However, an applicant that subsequently makes engineering 
changes that would diminish its fair distribution position must amend its application to reflect that diminished 
position. See 47 CFR §§ 1.65 and 73.7003(e).  Elijah’s revised fair distribution exhibit, which the staff inadvertently 
did not consider, reflects Elijah’s diminished position.
16 See Elijah Application and GPTC Application, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  
Elijah’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 16,634 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 
2,149 people.  GPTC’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 19,136 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second 
NCE service is 6,971 people.  Thus, each would provide combined first and second NCE service to at least 10% 
percent of the population within its respective 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people.
17 The applicant proposing to provide service to the greatest number of people will only be awarded a construction 
permit if it will provide such service to at least 10% of the people within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 
5,000 more people than the next best applicant.  See 47 CFR § 73.7002(b).
18 See 47 CFR § 73.7002(b); see also NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7420.
19 See Central Florida Educational Foundation, Inc. c/o Joseph E. Dunne, Esq., Letter Order, 22 FCC Rcd. 18332, 
18334 (MB 2007) (referring the matter to the Commission for consideration where the initial outcome would be 
altered by the potential for a new points analysis).  See also Comparative Consideration of 24 Groups of Mutually 
471Conclusion/Action.  For the reasons discussed above, IT IS ORDERED that the Petition to Deny 
(Pleading File No. 0000204974) filed by Georgia Public Telecommunications Commission on December 
9, 2022, IS DISMISSED AS MOOT.  
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the tentative selection of the application of Elijah Radio 
(Application File No. 0000167410) for authority to construct a new noncommercial educational FM 
station at Dasher, Georgia, IS RESCINDED.

APPENDIX B – Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
APPENDIX C – List of Commenters
I. INTRODUCTION
1. Unmanned aircraft are being used to deliver consumer packages and life-saving medical 
supplies, facilitate the rapid restoration of power infrastructure after a storm, and aid in first responder 
missions such as search and rescue and wildfire management, among innumerable other beneficial public 
and private uses.  These operations depend on wireless communications for purposes ranging from flight 
control communications between a ground-based control station and the unmanned aircraft (UA) 
(hereinafter referenced collectively in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) as an unmanned 
aircraft system or UAS) to the delivery of mission-related payload information from the UA.1  In this 
NPRM, we take several steps to promote access by UA operators to licensed spectrum for these purposes. 
2. First, we address the 5030-5091 MHz band, which the Commission previously allocated 
to support terrestrial control links for UAS without adopting service rules.  Because technical work 
regarding UAS is still in a nascent stage, we anticipate that service rules sufficient to facilitate UAS 
operations will likely require development in phases.  We now take the first step to develop such rules.  
We seek comment on service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band that will provide UAS operators with 
access to licensed spectrum with the reliability necessary to support safety-critical UAS communications 
links.  Second, due to the increasing interest in operating UAS using existing terrestrial flexible-use 
spectrum networks, we seek comment on whether the Commission’s rules are adequate to ensure co-
existence of terrestrial mobile operations and UAS use or whether changes to our rules are necessary.2  
Third, to further promote the safe integration of unmanned aircraft operations in controlled airspace and 
facilitate flight coordination, we propose a process for UAS operators to obtain a license in the 
aeronautical VHF band to communicate with air traffic control and other aircraft.  Together, these 
measures will help to promote the growth and safety of UAS operations.3 
3. This proceeding implicates the jurisdiction and concerns of multiple federal agencies.  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has the jurisdictional responsibility to ensure the safety of 
aircraft, including UAS, and is tasked by statute with the safe integration of UAS into the National 
Airspace System.4  The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), which 
administers the federal use of spectrum, has jurisdictional interests in the 5030-5091 MHz band, including 
1 More specifically, we use the term unmanned aircraft system(s) (UAS) in this NPRM to reference a UA together 
with all the associated elements (including communication links and the components that control the UA) that are 
required for the safe and efficient operation of the UA in the airspace of the United States.  As discussed below, we 
seek comment on our proposal to adopt this definition of “unmanned aircraft system” for the 5030-5091 MHz band 
service rules.
2 To this end, we seek comment on the sufficiency of the current flexible-use rules to prevent interference to and 
from UAS operations, and on whether we can eliminate the current prohibitions on airborne operations applicable to 
certain of these flexible-use bands.
3 We note that AURA Network Systems OpCo, LLC and A2G Communications, LLC, have a pending petition for 
rulemaking requesting rule changes to allow the 450 MHz General Aviation Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service 
band to be used for a broader range of services, including data communications with UAS.  See Petition for 
Rulemaking by AURA Network Systems OpCo, LLC and A2G Communications, LLC to Permit the Transmission 
of Data in Air-Ground Radio Telephone Automated Service Channels Between 454.675-454.975 MHz and 459.675-
459.975 MHz, RM-11912 (filed Feb. 16, 2021) (AURA/A2G Petition).  We expect to address the AURA/A2G 
Petition in another proceeding.
4 See 49 U.S.C. § 44802.  The National Airspace System consists of (1) a network of both controlled and 
uncontrolled airspace, (2) air navigation facilities, equipment and services, (3) airports and landing areas, (4)  
aeronautical charts, information and services, (5) rules and regulations, (6) procedures and technical information, 
and (7) manpower and material.  See FAA, National Airspace System, https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/nas/ (last

potentially using the band for federal UAS operations and ensuring the adequate protection of certain 
other federal uses in and adjacent to the 5030-5091 MHz band.  As a part of their respective jurisdictional 
responsibilities, both the FAA and NTIA have been examining the potential use of the 5030-5091 MHz 
band for UAS operations, and the FAA has adopted a minimum performance standard for UAS radio 
equipment operating in the 5040-5050 MHz sub-band of the 5030-5091 MHz band.5  Accordingly, a 
whole-of-government approach is needed to ensure that this proceeding addresses the relevant concerns 
and issues within the responsibility of each stakeholder agency and that our efforts in this area work in 
complement with those of our federal partners to support and promote the safe and productive operation 
of UAS.  To facilitate this approach, we have consulted with these agencies in the preparation of this 
NPRM, and will continue to do so as the proceeding advances. 
II. UAS COMMUNICATIONS IN THE 5030-5091 MHZ BAND
A. Background
4. Because a UA, to the extent its route is not pre-programmed, must be operated remotely, 
the operator depends critically on wireless communications between a ground-based control station and 
the UA to control the flight of the UA, including communications to send commands to the aircraft and to 
receive telemetry and other data from it.  UAS also increasingly employ wireless signals for other safety-
related purposes, such as to detect and avoid other aircraft.  Currently, no spectrum is licensed in the 
United States exclusively for UAS communications, and operators have generally relied on unlicensed 
operations or experimental licenses.  Neither of these spectrum resources provide the user with any right 
to protection from harmful interference, and as a result, the reliability of communications using these 
resources can be uncertain.  As UA flights increasingly involve operations with a higher risk profile, such 
as flights that use large aircraft, carry heavy cargo or human passengers, or travel into the controlled 
airspace used by commercial passenger aircraft,6 operators have a growing need for the greater reliability 
that interference-protected licensed spectrum provides for control-related and other safety-related 
communications.  
5. In 2017, the Commission determined that the 5030-5091 MHz band should be allocated 
to help address that need.7  Prior to the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12), the 
5 The FAA’s actions to integrate UAS into the National Airspace System have also involved many regulatory efforts 
not specific to the 5030-5091 MHz band.  For example, in 2016, the FAA, together with the Office of the Secretary 
of Transportation, adopted rules authorizing the routine operation of small UAs (those weighing less than 55 
pounds), subject to certain restrictions and limitations.  See Federal Aviation Administration and Office of the 
Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation, Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems, 81 Fed. Reg. 42064 (June 28, 2016) (to be codified at 14 CFR pts. 21, 43, 61, 91, 101, 107, 119, 133, 183).  
Among other restrictions, the rules did not permit such operations over people or at night without an individual 
waiver.  See id. at  42102, 42123.  Subsequently, the FAA modified these regulations and authorized routine 
operations of small UAs over people and operation at night under certain circumstances.  See Federal Aviation 
Administration and Office of the Secretary of Transportation, Department of Transportation, Operation of Small 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems Over People, 86 Fed. Reg. 4314, 4314-15 (Jan. 15, 2021).  At the same time, the FAA 
also adopted rules establishing requirements for the remote identification of UAs operating in the United States.  See 
Federal Aviation Administration, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft, 86 Fed. Reg. 4390 (Jan. 15, 2021) 
(Remote ID Rules). 
6 The FAA defines “controlled airspace” as “an airspace of defined dimensions within which air traffic control 
service is provided to [instrument flight rules] flights and to [visual flight rule] flights in accordance with the 
airspace classification.  NOTE: Controlled airspace is a generic term that covers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, 
and Class E airspace.”  14 CFR § 1.1 (General Definitions).  Controlled airspace is found around some airports and 
at certain altitudes where air traffic controllers are actively communicating with, directing, and separating all air 
traffic.  See FAA, Airspace 101: Rules of the Sky,

5030-5091 MHz band was allocated both internationally and in the United States to the aeronautical 
mobile-satellite (route) service (AMS(R)S) and the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARNS) on a 
primary basis.8  Footnote 5.444 of the Table of Frequency Allocations further provides that the spectrum 
is to be used for the operation of the international standard system (microwave landing system) for 
precision approach and landing and gives microwave landing systems priority over other uses of the 
band.9  At the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference, the United States proposed that the 5030-
5091 MHz band also be allocated to the aeronautical mobile (route) service (AM(R)S) on a primary basis 
in order to support terrestrial control links for UAS, in light of (1) the anticipated growth of UAS 
operations, (2) the limited use of the band worldwide at that time, and (3) the lack of microwave landing 
system deployment in the United States at 5030-5091 MHz.10  Consistent with the United States proposal, 
the 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference allocated the 5030-5091 MHz band internationally to 
the AM(R)S on a primary basis in all Regions.11
6. In 2017, the Commission adopted a Report and Order taking several steps in response to 
the decisions from the 2012 World Radio Conference.12  Among other measures, the Commission 
mirrored the international allocation at 5030-5091 MHz in its domestic allocations, specifically allocating 
the 5030-5091 MHz band to the AM(R)S on a primary basis for both federal and non-federal use.13  
Under the Commission rules, “AM(R)S” is defined as “[a]n aeronautical mobile service reserved for 
communications relating to safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national or international civil 
air routes.”14  The Commission found that adopting the new AM(R)S allocation would “support the 
anticipated growth of UAS and promote their safe operation.”15  The Commission did not adopt any rules

Under the Commission’s Table of Frequency Allocations rules, Aeronautical Mobile-Satellite Route Service 
(AMS(R)S) is defined as “[a]n aeronautical mobile-satellite service reserved for communications relating to safety 
and regularity of flights, primarily along national or international civil air routes.”  47 CFR § 2.1(c).  Aeronautical

services allocated on a “secondary” basis, see 47 CFR § 2.105(c)(2), but AM(R)S remains subject to the higher 
priority of MLS provided by Footnote 5.444.  See 47 CFR § 2.106, footnote 5.444.  The Commission also added 
Footnote 5.443C to this allocation band limiting its use to internationally standardized aeronautical systems and 
setting limits for unwanted emissions from AM(R)S stations to adjacent band radionavigation-satellite service 
(RNSS) downlinks to an EIRP density of -75 dBW/MHz.  See WRC-12 R&O, 32 FCC Rcd at 2717, para. 41; see

7.AIA Petition for Rulemaking.  On February 8, 2018, the Aerospace Industries Association 
(AIA) filed a petition for rulemaking recommending licensing and service rules for control-and-non-
payload communications (CNPC) links in the 5030-5091 MHz band to support UAS operations in the 
United States (AIA Petition).17  AIA proposed that individual UAS operators that meet certain 
qualifications or organizations that employed such operators be able to obtain a non-exclusive, nationwide 
Commission spectrum license, which would authorize them to use the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS 
CNPC subject to a dynamic frequency assignment process.18  AIA further recommended the Minimum 
Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for UAS CNPC links issued by RTCA in 2016 and 
designated as RTCA DO-362 as a “good starting point for the Commission’s consideration of licensing 
and operational rules[.]”19  Noting that the AM(R)S allocation of the band is limited to “communications

and Control in the 5030-5091 MHz Band, RM-11798 (filed Feb. 8, 2018) (AIA Petition).
18 See AIA Petition at 6-7, 9-10.  In its petition, AIA used the terms “control-and-non-payload” and “command-and-
control” (or C2) interchangeably.  See, e.g., AIA Petition at 7 (referring to “CNPC links”), 8 (referring to “C2 
communications links”).  We similarly do so throughout this NPRM.
19 See AIA Petition at 7.  RTCA is a standards development organization that works with the FAA to develop 
standards that can be used as means of compliance with FAA regulations.  See RTCA, About Us, 
https://www.rtca.org/about/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022).  RTCA Special Committees (SCs) develop Minimum 
Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) among other standards documents related to aviation.  See RTCA, 
Standards & Guidance Materials Descriptions, https://www.rtca.org/standards/standards-guidance-materials/ (last 
visited Sept. 6, 2022).  According to RTCA’s website, “MOPS provide standards for specific equipment(s) useful to 
designers, manufacturers, installers and users of the equipment. . . .  MOPS provide the information needed to 
understand the rationale for equipment characteristics and requirements stated, describe typical equipment 
applications and operational goals, and establish the basis for required performance under the standard.  Definitions 
and assumptions essential to proper understanding are provided as well as installed equipment tests and operational 
performance characteristics for equipment installations.”  Id.  RTCA MOPS are often referenced as a basis for 
equipment certification in FAA technical standard orders.  See id.  Technical standard orders establish minimum 
performance standards for specified materials, parts, and appliances used on civil aircraft.  See FAA, Technical 
Standard Orders (TSO), https://www.faa.gov/aircraft/air_cert/design_approvals/tso/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022).    
RTCA’s Special Committee 228 (SC-228), established on May 20, 2013, is working to develop, among other things, 
Command-and-Control Data Link MOPS for the 5030-5091 MHz band.  See RTCA, SC-228, Minimum 
Performance Standards for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, https://www.rtca.org/content/sc-228 (last visited Sept. 6, 
2022).  The committee published the first version in September 2016 with the release of DO-362, Command and 
Control (C2) Data Link Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) (Terrestrial) (RTCA DO-362).  In 
response, the FAA adopted Technical Standard Order C213, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Control and Non-Payload 
Communications Terrestrial Link System Radios, effective March 9, 2018.  See Federal Aviation Administration, 
Aircraft Certification Service, Technical Standard Order C213, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Control and Non-
Payload Communications Terrestrial Link System Radios (2018) (TSO-C213).  TSO-C213 adopted the RTCA DO-
362 standard as a minimum performance standard for new models of UAS CNPC Link System radios operating in 
the 5040-5050 MHz portion of the 5030-5091 MHz band.  See TSO-C213 at 1.  On December 20, 2022, the FAA 
issued a revision of TSO-C213, designated TSO-C213a.  See Federal Aviation Administration, Aircraft Certification 
Service, Technical Standard Order C213a, Unmanned Aircraft Systems Control and Non-Payload Communications 
Terrestrial Link System (2022) (TSO-C213a), available at FAA, Technical Standard Orders, 
https://drs.faa.gov/browse/TSO/doctypeDetails.  TSO-C213a replaces TSO-C213 going forward, adopting aspects of 
RTCA DO-362A, the second version of the RTCA MOPS for the 5030-5091 MHz band, as minimum performance 
standards for CNPC Link Systems designed for operations within any spectrum in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  See 
TSO-C213a at 2; RTCA, Command and Control (C2) Data Link Minimum Operational Performance Standards

relating to safety and regularity of flight,” AIA also advocated for prohibiting any non-UAS use of the 
5030-5091 MHz band or any UAS use for “payload communications or other non-safety or non-route 
services.”20  
8. The Commission sought public comment on AIA’s petition on April 26, 2018.21  Eight 
parties filed comments, and four filed replies.22  The majority of commenters supported commencement 
of a rulemaking to license the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS communications, and several supported 
aspects of the AIA proposal.23  Some raised concerns, however, that the proposal was too restrictive in the 
operations it would support or permit and that the 5030-5091 MHz band would not in any case be able to 
support all UAS operations; those commenters recommended that the Commission not preclude use of 
other bands for UAS operations.24
9.Section 374 Report.  Section 374 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 directs the 
FAA, the FCC, and NTIA to submit a report to specified committees of the House and Senate on, among 
other things, “whether [UAS] operations should be permitted, but not required, to operate on [the 5030-
5091 MHz band] on an unlicensed, shared, or exclusive basis, for operations within the [UAS Traffic 
Management] system or outside of such a system.”25  On November 25, 2019, the Office of Engineering 
and Technology (OET) and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) (collectively, the Bureaus) 
sought public comment on this issue and others identified in Section 374 of the FAA Reauthorization Act 
(Section 374 Public Notice).26  Twenty-three parties filed comments, and eleven filed replies.27  On 
August 20, 2020, the Bureaus jointly submitted a report to Congress on behalf of the Commission 
addressing the matters specified in Section 374.28  In their report, the Bureaus found that “[t]he 5030-5091 
MHz band appears to offer promise for intensive UAS use because it is unencumbered”29 and 
“recommend[ed] that the Commission initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop service and licensing 
rules enabling UAS use of the 5030-5091 MHz band in collaboration with the FAA and NTIA.”30

B. Discussion
11. As reflected in the comments to the AIA Petition and the record in response to the 
Refresh Public Notice, UAS manufacturers and other stakeholders have continued to express strong 
interest in a proceeding to enable licensing of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS CNPC links since the 
Commission added an AM(R)S allocation in the 5030-5091 MHz band to enable interference-protected 
UAS communications.33  The Section 374 Report released by WTB and OET in 2020 also supports the 
commencement of a rulemaking proceeding to adopt service rules enabling UAS operations in the 5030-
5091 MHz band.34  Accordingly, we propose to adopt a band plan and service rules in the 5030-5091 
MHz band to enable UAS operators to use interference-protected CNPC links.  We seek comment on our 
proposal and on options to make the band available for this purpose.  We further seek comment on the 
costs and benefits of any such options, including the costs and benefits of the specific band plan and 
service rules options discussed below.  UAS platforms offer potential benefits in particular to 
disadvantaged, remote and rural communities, including delivery of essential goods or medical and other 
critical supplies in hard-to-reach areas, as well as innovative agricultural uses.  We seek comment on 
measures that will facilitate UAS use and promote equity for these underserved populations.  We 
encourage stakeholders to develop and submit consensus recommendations on service rules for the 5030-
5091 MHz band, including recommendations on the issues and proposals discussed below. 
12. We do not intend to mandate that all UAS CNPC occur exclusively in the 5030-5091 
MHz band.  Other licensed bands, including the flexible-use bands where mobile networks are already 
deployed nationwide and the 450 MHz General Aviation Air-Ground band, are being explored as 
platforms for UAS operations, including UAS CNPC.  Commenters in this proceeding broadly support 
the availability of these bands as resources to help meet the rapidly growing spectrum access needs of the 
UAS community.35  In addressing the 5030-5091 MHz service rules, we do not propose to mandate that 
all CNPC occur within the band, nor do we intend that the future rules adopted in this proceeding for 
5030-5091 MHz will necessarily govern any UAS operations in other bands.  Rather, through this 
proceeding, we seek to provide UAS operators with access to an additional spectrum resource that may 
complement other spectrum resources that are currently available or in development.  The 5030-5091 
MHz band is a limited resource, and the demand for protected UAS CNPC may well exceed the capacity 
of the band as UAS operations increase over time.36  Further, while existing networks operating in other 
bands such as flexible-use bands may provide sufficient reliability for many UAS use cases, authorization 
of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS use offers an opportunity to apply standards and rules designed to

performed simulations that purport to show that, as the number of UAS per “cell” increases, both uplink data 
throughput and uplink latency increase to levels that may exceed acceptable target values.  See id., Attach. at 12-17.  
To combat these capacity issues in the 5030-5091 MHz band, Qualcomm suggests that terrestrial mobile networks in 
other bands could be utilized for lower altitude operations and offloaded to the 5030-5091 MHz band above a 
certain height threshold.  See id., Attach. at 22.

meet even the most safety-critical communications needs.37  In addition, as we discuss below, technical 
standards have already been developed for the 5030-5091 MHz band specifically to support reliable UAS 
CNPC, whereas work is still nascent to establish or demonstrate the reliability of CNPC standards or 
operations in other bands.  As a result, the 5030-5091 MHz band has the potential to be available for 
safety-critical aviation needs more quickly than licensed spectrum in these other bands.  We tentatively 
conclude that, while other spectrum bands are available for UAS communications, licensing the 5030-
5091 MHz band specifically for UAS CNPC will have important public interest benefits.  We seek 
comment on this tentative conclusion and the extent to which the 5030-5091 MHz band may offer unique 
advantages over other bands in supporting UAS CNPC.     
1. Band Plan
13. Below, we seek comment on an appropriate band plan for communications to support the 
growth and safety of UAS operations.  For the purpose of this band and its service rules, and consistent 
with the FAA definitions of the terms, we propose to define UAS as an unmanned aircraft (UA) and its 
associated elements (including communication links and the components that control the UA) that are 
required for the safe and efficient operation of the UA in the airspace of the United States, and to define a 
UA as an aircraft operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the 
aircraft.38  We seek comment on these proposed definitions and on any alternatives.  We further identify 
two broad UAS use cases for purposes of determining the appropriate band plan and service rules – non-
networked operations, generally occurring within radio-line-of-sight39 of the UAS operator, and network-
supported operations, which rely on network infrastructure to go beyond radio-line-of-sight of the 
operator.  Non-networked operations involve flights within a sufficiently localized area that can rely on 
direct wireless links between the UAS operator’s controller and the UA and therefore do not require any 
supporting network infrastructure.  Such operations may include, for example, tower or other site 
inspections, public safety operations, or localized surveillance.  In contrast, network-supported operations 
rely on deployed network infrastructure, such as cell towers and sites, to relay information between the 
operator and the UA and may therefore extend far beyond the range of direct wireless links between 
operator and UA.40  While UAS operations have in the past been predominantly non-networked 
operations, there is growing interest in and exploration of network-supported operations, such as for 
package delivery, mapping, search-and-rescue, long-range infrastructure inspections (e.g., involving 
37 See, e.g., ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 1 (asserting that the 5030-5091 MHz band is central to successful UAS 
development and advancement, “particularly for larger UAS operating in [FAA]-controlled airspace”).
38 See 14 CFR § 1.1; accord 49 U.S.C. § 44801(11), (12) (defining “unmanned aircraft” and “unmanned aircraft 
system”).  While our rule proposal thus focuses use of the band on communications for the operation of a type of 
aircraft, which meets the definition of a part 87 aviation service, see 47 CFR § 87.5, we note that a network-based 
communications service offered to operators of UAS would typically also be a commercial service providing access 
to wide-area networks, in contrast to the largely if not entirely non-commercial and non-network-based services 
regulated under part 87.  See generally 47 CFR pt. 87.  Below, we seek comment on the regulatory treatment of 
these services, including their placement in the organization of our rules.  See, e.g., infra paras. 70-73.
39 References to “line-of-sight” herein correspond to radio-line-of-sight.  This is in contrast to FAA rules, which 
consider whether UAS operations are within visual-line-of-sight rather than radio-line-of-sight.  See 14 CFR § 
107.31.  We focus on whether a UA is beyond-radio-line-of-sight in this context because the suitability of the 
different licensing approaches we consider below (direct link connections as opposed to network-based connections) 
appears to depend to a greater extent on whether an operation is within radio-line-of-sight of the operator than on 
whether or not an operation is in visual sight of the operator.  A UA that is beyond-visual-line-of-sight but within 
radio-line-of-sight can still be controlled by a direct wireless link between the controller’s radio and the UA.  
40 See, e.g., CTIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 (“To the extent this band is to be used for [beyond-line-of-sight], the 
spectrum will either need to be deployed on existing nationwide infrastructure, or brand-new infrastructure that can

in some cases, autonomous aircraft that do not require radio control.

railroad tracks, power distribution infrastructure, or pipelines) and long-range surveillance flights.41  We 
find substantial support in the response to the Refresh Public Notice for both use cases.42  We seek 
comment on whether any other UAS use cases should be considered in determining the appropriate band 
plan and service rules.
14. Hereinafter, we use the term Non-Networked Access (NNA) to indicate spectrum or 
licenses (e.g., NNA blocks) that would be governed by service rules appropriate to support non-
networked communications.43  Likewise, we use the term Network-Supported Service (NSS) in 
connection with spectrum or licenses to indicate that the relevant spectrum or licenses would be governed 
by service rules appropriate to support the provision of network-based services.44  Further, we propose to 
use NNA and NSS in the rules to designate the spectrum allocated for non-networked and network-
supported use cases, respectively.  
15. AIA suggests that RTCA’s terminology for these two use cases should be used.45  RTCA 
uses the term “point-to-point” for non-networked communications links and the term “Command-and-
Control Communications Service Providers” to describe network-supported services.46  We tentatively 
find that our proposed terminology is more descriptive of the use cases we seek to support, and that the 
use of the term point-to-point, which has been long used in Commission rules and orders to reference 
systems providing a data communication link between two fixed stations, may itself contribute to 
confusion in this context.47  We seek comment on the proposed terminology, and on alternatives. 
16. To accommodate both NNA and NSS in the 5030-5091 MHz band, we propose to 
partition the band, to dedicate different segments of spectrum in the band for each use case, and to license 
each of these segments in a manner that is appropriate to support the relevant use cases.  We seek 
comment broadly on the placement of NNA and NSS spectrum to ensure efficient, reliable, and safe use 
of the band.  We seek comment on whether to make spectrum available for multi-purpose uses, e.g., 
expansion bands for temporary NNA or NSS use.  For example, an NSS licensee operating a network in 
one of the NSS license blocks might request and receive a temporary assignment from a multi-purpose 
spectrum block to temporarily supplement the network provider’s spectrum capacity in a particular cell 
site in order to provide more capacity to an active UAS operation in that cell.  We seek comment on our 
proposals and on alternatives.  
17. We specifically propose to dedicate at least 10 megahertz of spectrum for NNA 
operations, and seek comment on this proposal.  AIA and AURA support initially dedicating 10 
megahertz for this purpose, and we find no support for dedicating less than 10 megahertz.48  AIA argues 
that 10 megahertz will be sufficient to promote deployment while preserving the opportunity for an

43 We seek comment elsewhere on whether the scope of permitted services should encompass types of 
communications other than CNPC. 
44 Network-supported operations will require a different licensing approach than non-networked access due to the 
need in the former case to provide the regulatory framework and incentives to support the investment in and 
deployment of substantial network infrastructure.

incremental approach to licensing the band that will better accommodate developing industry standards.49  
We seek comment on AIA’s argument.  We seek comment on the placement of the NNA spectrum within 
the band and whether, consistent with AIA’s proposal, we should place 5 megahertz blocks at the bottom 
(5030-5035 MHz) and top (5086-5091 MHz) of the band for NNA use.  Alternatively, should we locate 
the dedicated NNA blocks somewhere internal in the band rather than at the band edges?  If so, should we 
designate the spectrum at the edges of the band for NSS?  
18. An analysis by RTCA based in part on the use of an “online filter-design tool” finds that 
filters that sufficiently protect services in the adjacent bands “would necessitate guardbands unusable by 
terrestrial CNPC at both ends of the 5030-5091 MHz bands, reducing the 61 MHz of usable passband 
width to 42-52 MHz depending on the case.”50  It further states, however, that “[c]ustom filter designs 
could probably provide larger usable passbands than those obtained using the online tool, possibly at the 
cost of increased size and weight.”51  We seek comment on this analysis, and whether fixed guard bands 
at one or both ends of the band are warranted to protect services in the spectrum adjacent to the 5030-
5091 MHz band, including (1) radionavigation-satellite service (RNSS) downlinks in the 5010-5030 MHz 
band, (2) aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT) downlinks to support flight testing in the 5091-5150 MHz 
band, and (3) the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) in the 5000-5030 
MHz and 5091-5150 MHz bands.  Alternatively, does the need to protect adjacent band services argue for 
dedicating the edge spectrum to something other than NNA assignments, such as satellite?52  Below, we 
discuss more generally whether any measures beyond appropriate power and out-of-band-emissions limits 
are needed to protect these adjacent band services.
19. We further seek comment on whether, instead of designating separate upper and lower 
NNA blocks, we should place all dedicated NNA spectrum together in one contiguous block.  Is 
placement of the NNA spectrum into two or more separate blocks useful for technical or other reasons?  
Conversely, would providing the spectrum in a single contiguous block reduce interference challenges 
(e.g., by potentially reducing the adjacency of NNA and NSS blocks) or better support certain 
channelizations of the band or important use cases that may require channel bandwidths of more than 5 
megahertz?  Further, with regard to any technical standards that commenters may recommend applying to 
services or equipment in the 5030-5091 MHz band, we seek comment on whether these standards require 
the use of contiguous spectrum.53
20. With regard to the remaining spectrum in the band, we seek comment on how to structure 
it consistent with the goal of dedicating a segment of spectrum for exclusive use NSS licenses.  We seek 
comment on how much of the spectrum to dedicate for NSS operations, and how we should license any 
remaining spectrum.  For the spectrum that we dedicate to NSS operations, we seek comment on the 
placement of the NSS blocks and on the appropriate block size for NSS licenses to promote investment 
and competition and support the current and evolving bandwidth needs of NSS services.54  In the current 
49 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 7-8; see also AURA Refresh PN Comments at 8 (asserting that 10 megahertz 
will “accomplish the Commission’s goal of effectively promoting deployment”).

51 Id. at T.6.
52 For example, in its analysis, RTCA asserts that although any guard bands at the edge of the 5030-5091 MHz band 
“would be unusable by terrestrial CNPC links, they could still be used by satellite-based CNPC if a satellite system 
is built to take advantage of the AMS(R)S allocation.”  Id. at T.1.  We further discuss the protection of adjacent-
band services below. 
53 For example, L3H asserts that RTCA DO-362 requires CNPC uplinks or downlinks to operate within a contiguous 
channel.  See L3H Refresh PN Comments at 15.  
54  See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 17 (arguing that frequency band partitioning and channelization schemes 
should not impede future use of the spectrum by advanced radio technologies).

record, AIA proposes 5 to 10 megahertz blocks, and Wisk supports 10 megahertz blocks.55  We seek 
comment on these options and on any other appropriate block sizes.  Below, we seek comment on the 
appropriate scope of permissible services, including whether to restrict communications in the 5030-5091 
MHz band to CNPC, or permit transmissions of other types of communications.  What size spectrum 
blocks would be necessary to support CNPC services?  What block size would be appropriate if we 
permit NSS licensees to support non-CNPC communications?  Would the flexibility of larger block sizes 
(such as 10 or 20 megahertz) better facilitate mixed CNPC and non-CNPC use? 
21. While we anticipate that a significant portion of this remaining spectrum would be 
designated for NSS, we seek comment on whether we should use a portion of the spectrum for 
opportunistic use by both NNA or NSS licensees (multi-purpose use).  Should we instead use a portion of 
the spectrum to increase the amount of spectrum dedicated to NNA operations?  To the extent we 
dedicate spectrum for NSS licenses, we also seek comment on making that spectrum available for NNA 
operations on an interim, opportunistic basis.  Under this approach, NNA users, in addition to having 
access to dedicated NNA spectrum, could use frequencies in a dedicated NSS block in geographic areas 
where the NSS licensee has not yet deployed an operating network.  Once a network is deployed and 
operational in a particular area, NNA users would no longer have opportunistic access to the spectrum in 
that area.  This approach would enable the NSS spectrum in an area to be used productively prior to the 
issuance of NSS licenses and deployment of networks, while providing NSS licensees with complete 
exclusivity once their systems are deployed.  We seek comment on the costs and benefits of this 
approach, including its technical and economic feasibility, and on alternative approaches to NNA 
opportunistic access or alternative methods of ensuring productive usage of dedicated NSS spectrum prior 
to network deployment.
22. With these issues and questions in mind, we seek comment broadly on an appropriate 
band plan for the 5030-5091 MHz band.  As one possible option for structuring the band overall, we 
invite comment on: 
•Dedicating 10 megahertz of spectrum for NNA operations, with 5 megahertz blocks at the bottom 
(5030-5035 MHz) and top (5086-5091 MHz) of the band.
•Dedicating 40 megahertz of spectrum for NSS operations, divided into 4 licensed blocks of 10 
megahertz each, with NNA opportunistic access as described above.  
•Making the remaining 11 megahertz available for temporary, opportunistic use by either NNA 
users or NSS licensees (multi-purpose use).  
This potential option is illustrated in Figure 1; however, we seek comment on alternative band plans 
including plans that designate the edge spectrum for some purpose other than NNA operations (such as 
for NSS operations) or that provide different amounts of spectrum for NNA, NSS, and/or multi-purpose 
use than those presented in the depicted example.  
55 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 17 (asserting that a 5 megahertz block is sufficient to permit a provider to serve 
a decent-sized market and provide operational experience controlling out-of-band emissions and in-band 
interference); AURA Refresh PN Comments at 8-9 (recommending blocks of at least five megahertz to provide “the 
industry with sufficient bandwidth to tailor internal network requirements and to safety serve a variety of UAS use 
cases”); Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 6 (supporting 10 megahertz blocks); see also Qualcomm Refresh PN 
Comments at 2 (proposing that, for the “network mode” of UAS communications, the Commission license either 
four 10.25 megahertz blocks or two 20.5 megahertz blocks).
484Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
23. We further invite comment on alternative approaches to allocating the 5030-5091 MHz 
band for the support of UAS.  For example, AIA proposes that we allocate and license the 51 megahertz 
between 5035 MHz and 5086 MHz on a geographic area basis in a phased, incremental manner over a 
period of years—e.g., allocating and licensing only 5 megahertz in the first year, and then licensing 
additional spectrum over the following years with blocks and geographic areas sized according to user 
demand and service provider applications.56  AIA suggests that such an incremental approach would help 
the Commission to accommodate different UAS markets defined by different UAS missions that are 
expected to emerge over time.57  We seek comment on this possible approach, and more generally on 
whether we should allocate only a portion of the band at this time and defer allocation of the remainder of 
the band.  We further seek comment on whether we should preserve part of the band at this time for 
experimental use, or for potential future satellite-based CNPC that relies on the AMS(R)S allocation in 
the band.
24. As another alternative, Qualcomm recommends that the Commission allocate 20 
megahertz for direct UA-to-UA communications, including communications between the aircraft to 
facilitate detect and avoid (DAA) operations, and communications to broadcast Remote ID information.58

Industries Association, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, RM-11798 (filed Feb. 1, 2022) (AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex

the band for future licensing or use,” with the opportunity to open the band to new uses and updated technologies 
and standards).
58 See Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 1.  DAA involves a range of still-developing technologies to enable 
UAS or their operators to detect other aircraft or property and avoid collisions.  See, e.g., S. Ramasamy & R. 
Sabatini, A Novel Approach to Cooperative and Non-Cooperative RPAS Detect-and-Avoid, SAE Technical Paper 
2015-01-2470, 1 (Sept. 15, 2015), available at https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/2015-01-
2470/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022).  DAA can rely on transmissions in a variety of ground-based or aircraft-based 
implementations, for example non-cooperative detection methods such as on-board sensors or cooperative methods 
that involve the communication between UAS to facilitate cooperative collision avoidance.  See id.  Remote ID, as 
required by FAA rules that became effective on April 21, 2021, is the ability of UAS in flight to broadcast 
identification and location information that can be received by other parties.  See FAA, UAS Remote Identification, 
https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022). We note that FAA rules currently 
require Remote ID to be broadcast using devices authorized under the Commission’s part 15 rules.  See 14 CFR § 
89.320(g).
485Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
Qualcomm proposes that the remaining 41 megahertz of spectrum be licensed in two 20.5 megahertz 
blocks or four 10.25 megahertz blocks to network providers for the provision of NSS CNPC services and 
for payload transmissions to the extent that capacity is not needed for CNPC.59  We seek comment on this 
option and on Qualcomm’s assertion that supporting the functionalities of DAA and Remote ID 
broadcasts will require 20 megahertz of 5030-5091 MHz band spectrum.60  We also seek comment on the 
compatibility of UA-to-UA transmissions and UA broadcast with CNPC links between a ground control 
station and a UA.  If they are not compatible, should a portion of the band be designated exclusively for 
UA-to-UA or UA broadcast transmissions, and if so, how much spectrum should be designated for this 
purpose?61  
25. We seek comment on whether we should establish any internal guard bands, such as 
between the NNA and NSS blocks, or whether we can rely on appropriate technical rules to ensure that 
UAS operations in one block do not cause harmful interference to UAS operations in adjacent spectrum 
blocks.  We request that parties proposing guard bands provide detailed technical justification and specify 
the width and placement of the proposed guard bands.  We further seek comment on whether fixed guard 
bands at one or both ends of the band are warranted to protect services in the spectrum adjacent to the 
5030-5091 MHz band, including (1) radionavigation-satellite service (RNSS) downlinks in the 5010-5030 
MHz band, (2) aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT) downlinks to support flight testing in the 5091-5150 
MHz band, and (3) the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS) in the 5000-
5030 MHz and 5091-5150 MHz bands.  Below, we discuss more generally whether any measures beyond 
appropriate power and out-of-band-emissions limits are needed to protect these adjacent band services.
2. Dynamic Frequency Management System
26. To address the complexities involved in coordinating shared interference-protected 
access to the 5030-5091 MHz band, we propose that access to the band be managed by one or more 
dynamic frequency management systems (DFMS).  We use the term DFMS to describe a frequency 
coordination system that, in response to requests from UAS operators for frequency assignments in NNA 
spectrum, would determine and assign to the requesting operator, through an automated (non-manual) 
process, temporary use of certain frequencies for a particular geographic area and time period tailored to 
the operator’s submitted flight plan.  For the duration of the assignment, the operator would have 
exclusive and protected use of the assigned frequencies within the assigned area and timeframe, after 
which the frequencies would be available in that area for assignment to another operator.  We 
contemplate that each DFMS would be administered by a private third party, which we refer to as a 
DFMS administrator.  We further contemplate that each system would be capable of coordination-related 
activities across the entire 5030-5091 MHz band.  While we contemplate that NSS licensees would be 
responsible for the use and coordination of frequencies within the scope of their licenses, requiring a 
DFMS to be capable of coordination across the entire band would enable a DFMS to provide dynamic 
access to any portions of the 5030-5091 MHz band that are, in the initial order or subsequently, assigned 
for NNA use, as well as to implement opportunistic access to portions of the band that are assigned for 
NSS use as appropriate.  We tentatively conclude that these systems could (1) facilitate the efficient and 
intensive use of a limited spectrum resource for interference-protected CNPC; (2) give UAS operators 
access to reliable CNPC for operations where those communications links are safety-critical; (3) enable 
UAS operators to gain spectrum access in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner; (4) enforce 
compliance with frequency assignments through access controls, checking existing frequency 
59 See Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 2.
60 See Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 8 (asserting that 20 megahertz will be needed for “broadcasting of 
detection information by UAVs for ‘remain well clear’ messaging and collision avoidance, [broadcast Remote ID], 
and potentially other important safety and security use cases”).
61 See, e.g., AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte, Attach. at 5, 7 (suggesting that allocating some portion of the band for UAS 
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications would “provide situational awareness for UAS that cannot use ADS-B 
due to the Remote ID (RID) rule” but that 20 megahertz for V2V would be “an oversupply”).
486Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
assignments, providing updates in authorized databases, and other mechanisms; (5) protect critical 
communications inside the band and in adjacent spectrum; (6) support opportunistic use in unused 
portions of spectrum sub-bands designated for exclusive use licenses; and (7) promote rapid evolution of 
the use of the band in response to technological, market, or regulatory changes, such as if the Commission 
deploys spectrum in the band incrementally or, in the future, finds that modifying the access rules in a 
particular sub-band is in the public interest to better meet market demand.  We seek comment on our 
proposal and its costs and benefits.
27. The record and past Commission experience further lead us to tentatively conclude that 
the DFMS approach we propose is feasible and practical.  The record reflects support from a number of 
parties for the use of such a system to manage shared access to the 5030-5091 MHz band.62  In addition, 
the Commission has successfully relied on automated dynamic frequency management systems in other 
bands, including the Spectrum Access System (SAS) that was adopted in the 3.55-3.7 GHz band (3.5 
GHz band) to coordinate spectrum access to the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), allowing 
incumbent radar systems, licensed services, and licensed-by-rule services to coexist in the band.63  Several 
parties in the record state that aspects of the SAS can be leveraged or incorporated in the development and 
deployment of a DFMS.64  The support in the current record for the use of a DFMS, along with the 
success of the 3.5 GHz band SAS and the potential to build on the SAS experience and technology, lead 
us to tentatively conclude that a DFMS solution can feasibly be implemented to enable near-term use of 
the band with the benefits discussed above.  We seek comment on our tentative conclusion, and the extent 
of interest in providing such DFMS services in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  In addition to the specific 
questions below, what other aspects of the 3.5 GHz band SAS approach would be appropriate here, and 
what aspects should be changed?  How should the Commission supervise the operations of the DFMS? 
28. We propose to permit more than one DFMS to operate in the band, each providing access 
to frequencies nationwide, and to require coordination and communication between them to ensure that 
the assignments of one DFMS are consistent with the assignments of the others.  This approach would 
provide the benefits of competition to DFMS services, including promoting technological innovation in 
such services, encouraging responsiveness to market demands through tailored and differentiated 
services, helping to prevent discriminatory conduct based on potential conflicts of interest, and placing 
competitive pressure on fees and service quality.65  Further, the use of multiple competitive administrators 
was successfully implemented in the 3.5 GHz band, where the Commission has, to date, authorized six 
SASs for full commercial operations in the band.66  We seek comment on this proposal.
29.DFMS requirements and responsibilities.  We seek comment on the appropriate 
regulatory framework to establish for a DFMS, including its requirements and responsibilities and the

requirements and responsibilities of a DFMS administrator.  We seek comment on whether and to what 
extent we can draw on the requirements and responsibilities governing the SAS and SAS administrators 
in the 3.5 GHz band.67  For example, we seek comment on whether to follow our policy for the 3.5 GHz 
SASs and establish only the minimum high-level requirements necessary to ensure the effective 
development and operation of fully functional DFMSs, leaving other requirements to be addressed by the 
DFMS administrators and multi-stakeholder groups.68  If we follow this policy, what high-level 
requirements should we establish?  Below, we explore in greater detail a potential regulatory framework 
for DFMSs, and the extent to which aspects of the DFMS requirements and operation should be specified 
in our rules.
30. One of the most important responsibilities of the DFMS would be to ensure that UAS 
operators receiving 5030-5091 MHz assignments and operating consistent with their assignments are 
protected from harmful interference and that they do not cause harmful interference to other protected 
operations in the band and adjacent bands, including protected federal operations.69  In light of the many 
challenges of ensuring appropriate protection and reliability for all authorized UAS operations in the 
band, which could involve highly diverse and evolving operations with different risk profiles, altitudes, 
flight speeds, and spectrum needs in a shared spectrum environment, and could potentially involve the 
need for mid-flight alterations to flight plans and other operational complications, we seek comment on 
whether the Commission should simply establish an appropriate high-level requirement on the DFMS, 
such as a requirement to provide protected access to spectrum appropriate to cover a submitted and valid 
request, to the extent such spectrum is available, and defer to the DFMS administrators, or potentially a 
multi-stakeholder group, to determine the appropriate means of doing so.  To the extent the Commission 
should codify more detailed requirements, we seek comment on all measures the Commission should 
adopt to facilitate the ability of the DFMS to provide reliable, interference-protected assignments, 
including any necessary specifications, requirements, responsibilities, authority, processes, or remedies.  
We further seek comment on the interference mitigation techniques that can be employed by UAs, such as 
geo-fencing.70

comply with any Commission enforcement instructions they receive, as well as to securely transfer all the 
information in the DFMS to another approved entity in the event it does not continue as the DFMS 
Administrator at the end of its term.  We seek comment on these proposals.  In addition, what 
requirements should we impose on the DFMS or DFMS administrator with regard to retention of records 
and information, including registration and assignment records?  Should we require retention of all such 
information for at least five years?  What requirements should we adopt to ensure data security in DFMS 
operations, including the security of end-to-end communications between operators and a DFMS and the 
security of information stored by a DFMS?

use of the spectrum?  Should these requirements be high-level, with additional development through a 
DFMS administrator or multi-stakeholder group, or should they be more detailed?  What information 
should we require operators to provide to the DFMS regarding ground stations and unmanned aircraft 
stations?  Should that information be provided prior to any requests, with an assignment request, or on an 
ongoing or periodic basis during an operation?  For example, should we require operators to provide 
ground station geographic location, effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP), and/or antenna 
patterns?  Assuming a DFMS has the necessary information about the ground station, is information 
about the location or transmitter characteristics of the UA unnecessary to prevent harmful interference?  
Should we require an active UAS relying on an NNA assignment in the band to provide a DFMS with the 
UA information that must be broadcast under the Remote ID rule or some subset or variation of that 
information?71  Should an operator be required to provide the DFMS specific information about the UA, 
including its manufacturer, model, or other technical or identifying information?  Should an operator be 
required to affirmatively communicate to the DFMS, in real time or within a certain period of time of the 
relevant event, the initiation and termination of the flight or, alternatively, the initiation and termination of 
the operator’s use of the assigned frequencies?  Are there other circumstances or information (aside from 
the request) that the operator should be required by rule to communicate to the DFMS?  Should any 
requirements be imposed on UAS operators relying on NSS networks to facilitate the DFMS’s ability to 
provide interference-protected NNA assignments?
33. We further seek comment on whether to mandate that a UAS operator register with a 
DFMS as a precondition to requesting NNA frequency assignments, and if so, what requirements we 
should impose with respect to such registration.  Should the Commission simply require registration and 
leave the details to be developed by, for example, the DFMS administrators or a multi-stakeholder group?  
To the extent the Commission should codify further details, what information should be included with 
registration?  Should UAS operators be required to register ground and UA stations?  Should we impose 
requirements with regard to if and when registration should be updated and, if so, what is the appropriate 
duration of the initial registration term and the renewal term?  Under what circumstances should the 
Commission or the relevant DFMS administrator revoke a UA operator’s registration?  While we 
envision that any registration requirements would apply only to operators seeking NNA assignments, we 
seek comment on whether to require operators relying on a network service in NSS spectrum to register 
with a DFMS.
34. We also seek comment on what requirements, if any, we should impose with respect to 
the submission of UAS operator requests for NNA assignments, and conversely what, if any, details of 
the request process should be left to be developed by a multi-stakeholder group.  For example, should we 
impose specifications of what information should be included in a request, and if so, what data should we 
require?  Should requests include the relevant ground and unmanned aircraft stations that will be used in 
the operation, and if so, how should these be identified?  To the extent we permit mobile ground stations, 
71 The FAA’s rules for Remote ID require most UAS operating in United States airspace to have Remote ID 
capability.  See Remote ID Rules at 4403-04; 49 CFR § 89.101.  Remote ID capability includes the broadcast of 
information such as the identity, location, and altitude of a drone in flight, including its control station or take-off 
location.  See 14 CFR § 89.305.     
489Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
should requests provide a specification of the route of the mobile ground station over time and the times 
at which the station will reach specific locations in order to enable frequency assignment to consider the 
range coverage of the station as a function of time?  Should we require submission of a flight plan, and if 
so, what information should the flight plan include, and in what format?  For example, should it specify 
time of use, and flight positions and flight altitude over the course of the flight plan, as suggested by 
AIA?72  Should an operator be required to submit requests no more than a certain specified time period in 
advance of a flight?73     
35. As a general matter, should a DFMS grant a frequency assignment for the duration and 
other parameters requested, provided the unassigned spectrum is available to meet the request?  
Alternatively, should limits or restrictions be placed on what can be granted?  For example, should a limit 
be placed on the maximum duration of an assignment to prevent monopolization of the spectrum by one 
or a few parties with flights of long or indefinite duration?74  Should a limit be placed on the number of 
simultaneous temporary frequency assignments allowed by the DFMS to reduce the potential for harmful 
interference?  
36. As several parties have noted, operators may need to revise their assignments after a 
flight has commenced (e.g., where the flight needs to deviate from its anticipated flight path and UAS 
CNPC transmissions for the revised flight would not be covered by the original assignment, or where a 
flight takes longer than provided under the assignment).  We seek comment on any rules we should adopt 
to enable or facilitate the filing and timely processing of such requests for revised assignments or to 
otherwise address an operator’s mid-flight need for revised assignment.  Do we need to adopt any rule to 
address cases where the revised request cannot be granted consistent with other previously granted 
assignments?
37. In the 3.5 GHz band, SASs may require fixed stations to implement reassignment to new 
frequencies, reduction of the permitted transmitting power level, or cessation of operations, as necessary 
to avoid or eliminate harmful interference and implement spectrum access priorities.75  We note, however, 
that the 5030-5091 MHz band presents challenges to such an approach that are not present in the 3.5 GHz 
band.  First, whereas the 3.5 GHz stations under SAS control are all fixed stations (i.e., stations operating 
from a fixed location), facilitating a SAS’s ability to communicate with such stations and determine their 
location, we seek comment below on permitting UAS ground stations in the NNA portion of the 5030-
5091 MHz band to be mobile stations (e.g., hand-held controllers).76  Second, active management of 
spectrum access during an ongoing UAS operation could introduce significant safety hazards, such as if a 
DFMS were to require automatic cessation or powering-down of a UAS CNPC link while a flight was 
ongoing, resulting in a mid-operation loss of control.77  Given such challenges, is an active management 
72 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 9.
73 See AIA Petition at 14 (indicating that RTCA DO-362 “anticipates” that requests will be made no more than 20 
minutes in advance of a flight).  But see RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 4 (stating that “[i]n some circumstances, 
requests for channel assignments for flights could be made days in advance”).
74 See, e.g., dronelife, Heavy Lift Tethered Drone Flies for a Week: Zenith AeroTech Celebrates 108 Hours of 
Uninterrupted Flight, https://dronelife.com/2021/06/10/heavy-lift-tethered-drone-flies-for-a-week-zenith-aerotech-
celebrates-108-hours-of-uninterrupted-flight/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022).
75 See 47 CFR § 96.39(c)(2).
76 See infra para. 58 & n.112.
77 For this reason, some parties in the record oppose mechanisms that would automatically revoke an assignment 
after the duration of assignment has expired.  See EEI Refresh PN Comments at 8 (“Frequency assignments should 
not be revoked during flights because it would create potential safety concerns.”); L3H Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 
(suggesting that use of an assignment beyond its duration should be subject to post-flight investigation and 
enforcement, but that “[r]evocation of a frequency channel should never occur during a UAS flight”).  But see 
RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 5 (stating that automatic revocation of an assignment without confirmation from 
(continued….)
490Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
approach feasible and appropriate, and if so, what regulatory requirements should be adopted to enable or 
implement such an approach?  If not feasible, what approaches or mechanisms will be available to the 
DFMS to ensure the reliability of communications?  In particular, given that the proposed assignments 
would be limited in both frequency, time, and geography, what requirements, procedures, penalties, or 
other measures should be in place to prevent or address (1) flights that use unauthorized frequencies; (2) 
flights that occur outside an authorized time period, such as a flight that exceeds its authorized duration; 
or (3) flights that occur outside an authorized area.  If a DFMS’s role is merely to reserve appropriate 
spectrum for UAS flights, and a DFMS takes no other active measures to ensure or enforce compliance 
with the assignments or the protection of operations, will spectrum access be sufficiently reliable for 
mission critical purposes?
38.Fees.  Under the 3.5 GHz rules, an SAS administrator is authorized to charge users “a 
reasonable fee” for the provision of its services, and the Commission “can require changes to those fees if 
they are found to be unreasonable.”78  We propose to adopt a similar provision authorizing the 
administrator of a DFMS to charge reasonable fees for its provision of services, including registration and 
channel assignment services, and to permit parties to petition the Commission to review fees and require 
changes if they are found to be excessive.  To encourage efficient use of the limited spectrum resource 
and discourage any attempt at warehousing, we seek comment on specifically authorizing reasonable 
usage-based fees, and on standards and approaches for establishing the amounts of such fees.
39.Selection process.  We seek comment on the process for selecting the DFMS 
administrators, and whether the 3.5 GHz SAS approval process could serve as a model.79  Under the 
approach for SAS approval, the Commission delegated authority to WTB and OET to administer the 
process and provided that (1) the Bureaus would issue a Public Notice requesting proposals from entities 
desiring to administer a SAS; (2) applicants would be required, at a minimum, to demonstrate how they 
plan to meet the Commission’s rules governing SAS operations, demonstrate their technical qualifications 
to operate a SAS, and provide any additional information requested by WTB and OET; (3) based on these 
applications, WTB and OET would determine whether to conditionally approve any of the applicants; and 
(4) any applicants that received conditional approval would be required to demonstrate that their SASs 
meet all the requirements in the rules and any other conditions the Bureaus deemed necessary, and at a 
minimum, to allow their systems to be tested and analyzed by Commission staff.80  We seek comment on 
adopting this approach.  In particular, we seek comment on facilitating the potential selection of multiple 
DFMSs through an application and certification process by which any entity found to meet the 
requirements can be the administrator of such a system, and we seek comment on what eligibility 
requirements should be set and whether (or to what extent) they should be codified or established through 
a separate process.  We also seek comment on whether we should provide a testing or trial phase for 
DFMS technology prior to the submission of applications, to facilitate or inform the requirements of the 
application process.  Following the SAS model, we propose to delegate jointly to WTB and OET the 
the UAS operator “should happen only after the frequency assignment manager has followed documented, disclosed 
and agreed upon . . . safety procedures”).

make determinations regarding the continued acceptability of individual SAS Administrators; and to perform other 
functions as needed for the administration of the SAS”).
491Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
authority to administer the selection process and make the selection.  We seek comment on what role the 
FAA and NTIA should have in setting up the process, reviewing applications, and making the selection.
40.Coordination with flight authorization.  In addition to spectrum access, i.e., authorization 
to transmit, UAS operators also need approved or otherwise authorized access from the FAA to conduct 
flights in the airspace of the United States.  For example, under part 107, UAS operators are authorized to 
fly in uncontrolled airspace below 400 feet above the ground (AGL) and in accordance with part 107 of 
the FAA’s rules without specific airspace authorization, whereas part 107 flights in controlled airspace 
generally require a specific airspace authorization from air traffic control.81  Under the UAS Traffic 
Management (UTM) program, however, the FAA has been developing a separate ecosystem of 
requirements, services, and other features to enable the traffic management of low-altitude UAS 
operations, including systems for automating the flight approval process.82  One result of the program has 
been the deployment of the Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) system, 
through which UAS operators can apply to LAANC service providers to receive a near real-time airspace 
authorization for operations under 400 feet in controlled airspace around airports.83
41. We seek comment on whether and how frequency assignments should be coordinated 
with airspace authorization for low altitude, high altitude, and terminal (departure/arrival) operations.  For 
example, should a DFMS be required to determine that a requesting party has any necessary flight 
authority as a condition of granting a spectrum assignment request?  If so, we seek comment as to 
whether and how a DFMS would interact with air traffic control or the relevant UTM systems (such as 
LAANC), or otherwise obtain information regarding airspace approvals, authorizations, or availability.
42.Alternative approaches to dynamic spectrum access.  We seek comment on other options 
to enable dynamic spectrum access to the 5030-5091 MHz band.  Some parties suggest that we adopt 
some form of cognitive radio solution, in which UAS radios would directly detect and identify available 
spectrum channels.84  They argue that a centralized system like the DFMS will be complex and labor 
intensive to use, will be inefficient in spectrum assignments and vulnerable to spectrum warehousing, and 
will have difficulty ensuring link protection and responding quickly to developments such as changes in 
flight plans while a UA is already in flight.85  We seek comment on these concerns and whether they can 
be addressed by a DFMS, and we seek comment on the feasibility, costs, and benefits of alternative 
options as compared to the DFMS discussed above, and whether such alternatives would be sufficiently 
reliable to support even the most safety-critical uses such as flights in controlled airspace.  We further 
seek comment on whether there are existing technologies that could be applied or adapted to implement 
these alternative approaches, and on any standards work or other studies regarding the safety and 
reliability of links under such systems.
43. We note that the Commission has, in two cases, adopted a variation of the DFMS 
approach in which, for a particular device to access the relevant spectrum band, automated and periodic

further consideration”); SSC Refresh PN Comments at 4-5 (proposing a system including “multiple types of 
evidence” to determine availability including database query and optional device-based sensing). 
85 See, e.g., SSC Refresh PN Comments at 9-11.
492Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
queries of spectrum availability are made to a central database by the device itself.  In the 6 GHz band, 
the Commission adopted a system that allows unlicensed access to temporarily unused portions of the 
band while protecting incumbent services through a database of incumbent operations that certain 
unlicensed devices must query to determine available channels for their coverage area.86  Similarly, in the 
TV bands, the Commission established a TV white space database that is queried by an unlicensed device 
seeking access to the bands and that authorizes operations only on unused spectrum throughout the 
unlicensed device’s coverage area.87  We seek comment on whether a similar system could be adopted for 
NNA operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band, under which 5030-5091 MHz radios would be required to 
directly and periodically query a central database for available channels.  Given that the 6 GHz and white 
space systems are implemented to enable unlicensed devices to access spectrum without interference 
protection, we seek comment on whether this type of system could be suitable to implement interference 
protection for UAS NNA operations.  Could such a system be implemented in a manner that provides an 
assignment of protected spectrum that covers all applicable stations in a particular UAS NNA operation 
(e.g., both the operator’s control station and the associated airborne radio) and ensures protected access 
for the duration of an entire UAS flight plan?  Alternatively, could such a device query function be added 
to the DFMS as a second and optional means of receiving authorization from the DFMS for use cases 
where such authorization is sufficient?  If the Commission adopts rules providing for the establishment of 
such a system, should we require that the system database be updated in real time with relevant 
parameters of the NNA systems currently in operation?  We further seek comment on whether any such 
system and any tool used to perform the interference analysis should be certified and approved for use by 
the Commission and/or other appropriate authorities prior to operation. 
44. In the event that we adopt rules providing for the establishment and operation of a DFMS 
or some other coordination system or process, there may be a significant period of time before such 
coordination system is operational in the band and some operators may want protected access to the band 
during this interim period.  While such operators may currently apply for special temporary authority to 
use the band, these authorizations do not provide interference protection.88  Accordingly, we seek 
comment on whether to establish some method by which operators can get temporary protected access to 
frequencies in the 5030-5091 MHz band, or a portion of the band, during this interim period.  Should we 
provide that parties may apply during this period for licenses comparable to grants of part 5 special 
temporary authority (STA) (e.g., a duration of no more than 6 months) but with rights of interference 
protection, and subject to pre-application coordination through a frequency coordinator group and to 
termination in the event a DFMS becomes operational?  Should such uses have the same opportunity for 
renewal as part 5 STAs?  Moreover, we seek comment on an interim frequency management process 
through which parties could obtain limited, short-term access to spectrum, such as access suitable for a 
single flight or event.
3. Multi-stakeholder Group 
45. We seek comment on a possible role for a multi-stakeholder group to help develop the 
requirements and processes applicable to the DFMSs, as well as to study standards and interference issues 
associated with UAS operations in the band.  There are aviation-specific considerations that may affect 
how spectrum access should be managed, and it may be beneficial for stakeholders versed in such

493Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
considerations (e.g., members of the aviation industry, the UAS standards-making community, frequency 
managers, and network operators) to assist in the development of requirements and processes.  In the 
context of the 3.5 GHz band, the Commission encouraged the informal creation of a multi-stakeholder 
group to develop various implementation details to facilitate development of CBRS, and this approach 
proved highly successful.89  This informal reliance on multi-stakeholder group activities has been adopted 
in other contexts as well, including the implementation of Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) 
systems in the 6 GHz band.90  Further, several parties in the record support a role for a multi-stakeholder 
group to further develop requirements for the DFMS and the 5030-5091 MHz band, although some 
advocate the designation of a more formal, governing body to serve in this role.91  We seek comment on 
whether, consistent with the successful approach in the 3.5 GHz band, we should encourage a multi-
stakeholder group to address implementation issues in the 5030-5091 MHz band, but without the 
Commission formally designating such a group or imposing a formal process for how the group reaches 
its determinations or recommendations.  If such a multi-stakeholder group were to be formed by third 
parties, what selection procedures might be desirable to ensure that the group appropriately reflects the 
diversity of UAS stakeholders?  What role might federal agency stakeholders have in this process?  We 
seek comment on these and any additional procedures or approaches that a multi-stakeholder group might 
implement, particularly in light of the positive experience with the 3.5 GHz band stakeholder group.    
46. Assuming there is a role for a multi-stakeholder group, we seek comment on the 
appropriate extent of that role and the responsibilities it might most usefully undertake.  We seek 
comment on the matters a multi-stakeholder group should address with consensus standards or other 
determinations, or with the development of recommendations to one or more of the stakeholder agencies.  
We further seek comment on the matters that the Commission should address independently of any multi-
stakeholder group and the rules it should adopt to establish a basic regulatory framework to govern the 
5030-5091 MHz band and the DFMSs.
89 See 3.5 GHz R&O, 30 FCC Rcd at 4081, paras. 416, 417 (finding that a multi-stakeholder group could be 
instrumental in developing answers to some of the novel technical questions raised by the CBRS rules, declining to 
formally designate a group or adopt a specific process for reviewing and responding to their recommendations, but 
encouraging any such group to work to share their findings with the Commission and to incorporate their work, to 
the extent feasible, into the development of the 3.5 GHz band SAS and citizens band radio service devices).  To 
serve as a multi-stakeholder group for this purpose, the Wireless Innovation Forum (WInnForum) created the 
Spectrum Sharing Committee, which, inter alia, collaborated with relevant government agencies to develop 10 
standards for the 3.5 GHz band addressing a range of CBRS and SAS technical and operational issues.  See, e.g., 
WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 1-2.
90 See 6 GHz R&O, 35 FCC Rcd at 3918-19, paras. 174-80 (encouraging the formation of a multi-stakeholder group 
to provide a forum for the industry to study technical and operational issues raised by 6 GHz band unlicensed access 
and work cooperatively towards solutions); see also Expanding Flexible Use of the 3.7 to 4.2 GHz Band, GN Docket 
No. 18-122, Report and Order and Order of Proposed Modification, 35 FCC Rcd 2343, 2467, para. 333 (2020).

approach taken in the 3.5 GHz band and rely on cross-industry stakeholder groups to develop consensus standards 
for the performance of a shared access system for the 5030-5091 MHz band), with AIA Refresh PN Comments at 
13, 18 (recommending that the Commission and FAA jointly authorize an independent governing board to oversee 
the band), and ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 8 (supporting the establishment of a “governing body formed from 
the UAS user community with FAA and Commission participation to oversee the frequency management system”).  
See also L3H Refresh PN Comments at 2, 5-6 (proposing that the FCC and FAA collaborate with industry to 
establish a “UAS Spectrum Committee” responsible for establishing policies, procedures, and standards for 
assignment of frequencies and procedures for processing frequency requests, as well as policies and procedures for 
releasing channels following the end of flight).  While AIA proposes establishment of a formal “governing body,” it 
also discusses a potential role for “standards development organizations” to determine standards for such matters as 
the returning of frequency assignments.  See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 10, 13.
494Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
4. Scope of Permissible Services
47. In considering the appropriate scope of services to permit in the band, we begin with the 
services permitted by the underlying allocation.  As discussed above, the Commission added an AM(R)S 
allocation in the 5030-5091 MHz band to support UAS communications.  AM(R)S is reserved exclusively 
for communications relating to the safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national or international 
civil air routes.92  Consistent with the scope of the allocation and the expressed purpose for its 
incorporation, we propose to permit only CNPC and to define CNPC as any UAS transmission that is sent 
to or from the UA component of the UAS and that supports the safety or regularity of the UA’s flight.93  
We seek comment on these proposals and on alternatives that would be consistent with the allocation and 
its purpose.  Should we alternatively define CNPC to cover any communications to or from a UA other 
than payload communications, and to define payload as information sent to achieve mission objectives?94  
RTCA DO-362A, which provides MOPS for UAS CNPC in the 5030-5091 MHz band, states that 
“payload communications,” for purposes of the standard, “specifically include communications associated 
with the UA mission payloads, which do not contain safety-of-flight information,” and clarifies that 
“[s]afety-of-flight information is any information/data sent to or received from the UA that is necessary to 
ensure the UAS is operated/operating in a manner that protects people and/or property from harm due to 
unintentional events.”95  We seek comment on whether to adopt these or similar terms to define the scope 
of permissible CNPC.  NTIA proposes that we limit the band to a subset of CNPC, specifically 
communications for the control of the UA and other “safety-critical functions,” in order to limit UAS use 
to “essential services.”96  RTCA DO-362A similarly provides that CNPC includes “[d]ata and information 
sent to/from the Pilot Station and the UA for the control of the UA and other safety-critical functions.”97  
We seek comment on this option, on the costs and benefits of limiting the band to only the “safety-
critical” communications, on what types of communications would be considered “safety-critical,” and 
what, if any, types of non-payload but safety-related communications would not be considered “safety-
critical.”  More generally, should we restrict communications to a subset of CNPC?
48. Conceivably, the same data from a UA may be both for the purpose of achieving flight 
mission objectives and for flight safety-related purposes, for example, video transmissions relied upon 
both as surveillance data and to assist in flight guidance, or UA telemetry data with respect to local 
weather conditions such as turbulence and wind shear.  We seek comment on whether such dual-purpose 
communications should be permissible if one of the purposes falls within the permissible scope.98  Would 
it better serve the public interest to only include communications that are exclusively for purposes of 
flight safety or regularity?
92 See 47 CFR §§ 2.1, 2.106.  
93 See ASRI Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 (arguing that band access should be dedicated to “UAS safety and 
regularity of flight communications”); AURA Refresh PN Comments at 6; Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 8;

should not be sent over systems using this band.”).

to achieve mission (payload) objectives”); AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11.

49. We seek comment on whether, instead of a general definition of scope or, potentially, as 
a clarifying and non-exclusive supplement to a general definition, we should specify certain categories of 
communications that are covered, such as (1) telecommands to the UA; (2) telemetry from the UA that is 
relied upon for flight guidance or other flight safety-related purposes, such as geo-fencing to protect 
sensitive areas, i.e., Microwave Landing System sites, radio astronomy sites, adjacent licensees, etc.; (3) 
DAA-related transmissions; (4) video transmissions from the UA relied upon for flight guidance or other 
flight safety-related purposes; (5) Air Traffic Control communications relayed via the UA; and (6) remote 
identification transmissions.  We seek comment on whether any of these categories should be narrowed, 
broadened, eliminated, replaced, or supplemented with other categories.99  We seek comment on whether 
permissible communications should be restricted to communications between the control station and the 
UA station, i.e., excluding broadcast from the UA or UA-to-UA communications.  We further seek 
comment on whether we should establish priorities among different categories of CNPC, or leave the 
rules flexible on this matter, with such prioritization potentially to be considered and developed through 
appropriate standards development by multi-stakeholder groups.100  Commenters should also consider the 
impact of these potentially covered communications on the capacity of the band, i.e., whether the addition 
of these categories of communications allows for sufficient spectrum to support the core purpose of the 
band, CNPC links.       
50. We note that the regulatory definition of AM(R)S limits the allocation to communications 
“relating to safety and regularity of flight, primarily along national or international civil air routes.”101  
As the allocation does not require that communications be exclusively for flights along such air routes, we 
propose not to restrict the scope of permissible CNPC services to such communications.  We seek 
comment on this proposal and the extent to which operations outside civil air routes will need access to 
the 5030-5091 MHz band for CNPC (as opposed to being able to rely on other spectrum solutions that 
may or may not provide the same level of reliability or air safety assurance).  Assuming some measure is 
necessary or appropriate to reflect the focus on flights primarily along national or international civil air 
routes, we seek comment on whether it would be sufficient to ensure that the applicable rules and 
technical standards provide the necessary reliability and safety to support the use of the band for such 
flights.
51. We also seek comment on whether we should restrict NNA to CNPC but permit NSS 
licensees a broader scope such as a scope permitting UAS payload communications or permitting both 
UAS and non-UAS communications, provided that licensees ensure the safety and reliability of CNPC 
and ensure that communications associated with the safety of flight always have both priority and 
99 AURA, for example, asserts that categories that can be supported consistent with the AM(R)S allocation include 
(1) UAS flight control and configuration messages; (2) high priority detect-and-avoid messages, (3) ATC 
communications; (4) flight safety telemetry messages; (5) other flight safety messages; (7) routine telemetry 
messages; and (7) air traffic services other than ATC communications.  See AURA Refresh PN Comments at 6; cf. 
RTCA, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for C2 Link Systems Supporting Operations of 
Unmanned Aircraft Systems in U.S. Airspace, RTCA DO-377A (2021) (RTCA DO-377A), Appx. E at E.3, Fig. E-2 
(describing the categories of non-payload internal and external information exchange between a control station and a 
UA as (1) Aircraft Control telecommands; (2) Aircraft Control telemetry; (3) Navaids Setting Changes; (4) Navaids 
Display Data; (5) ATC Voice Relay; (6) Target Data (DAA); (7) Weather Radar Data; (8) Non-Payload Video; and 
(9) C2 Link Management).
100 AIA, for example, describes a prioritization of CNPC under the International Civil Aviation Organization 
(ICAO) Annex 10 Volume VI Part I Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) to be applied in both the 
Forward and Return directions of a “C2 Link System.”  See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11-12.  This scheme 
prioritizes data as follows: (1) UAS flight control and configuration messages; (2) high priority DAA messages; (3) 
ATC communications including distress calls and urgency messages; (4) flight safety telemetry messages including 
low priority DAA messages; (5) other flight safety messages; (6) routine telemetry messages; (7) air traffic services 
other than ATC communications; and (8) other communications related to safety and regularity of flight.  See id.

496Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
preemption over other communications.102  We see at least two potential distinctions between NNA and 
NSS operations that may argue for a broader NSS scope of service.  First, NSS operations will require 
deployment of networks that will necessitate a very substantial investment, in contrast to NNA operations 
that can occur without any network deployment.  We seek comment on whether permitting a broader 
scope of services is necessary to provide adequate financial incentives to support network buildout in 
NSS spectrum.  Second, network technologies may be better positioned than direct-link systems to 
implement a successful prioritization of CNPC.  We seek comment on this possibility, and to what extent 
current or developing network technologies or architectures are capable of ensuring the safety and priority 
of CNPC information over that associated with other traffic and whether these technologies or 
architectures will be compatible with other authorized operations in the band and/or with the TDD 
requirements of RTCA DO-362A.  We seek comment on whether such an expansion of scope would be 
permissible under section 303(y) of the Communications Act, which places certain limits on the 
Commission’s authority to “allocate electromagnetic spectrum so as to provide flexibility of use.”103  
52. If we conclude that NSS licensees should be permitted a broader scope of permissible 
communications on an ancillary basis, we seek comment on adding an appropriate allocation if necessary, 
on what type of allocation should be adopted to support the broader scope, on whether to subject the 
allocation to secondary status under the AM(R)S allocation and to the limitations applicable to the 
AM(R)S allocation, and on any measures we should adopt to ensure that the primary use of the spectrum 
is for CNPC.  Should we rely on appropriate multi-stakeholder groups to develop the details of 
requirements to implement prioritization and preemption?  Should any mechanisms for implementing 
preemption and prioritization be subject to specific review and approval by the Commission, the FAA, 
and/or an appropriate third-party group?
5. Eligibility Restrictions
53. We propose that any entity be eligible to obtain a 5030-5091 MHz NSS license other than 
those precluded by section 310 of the Communications Act and those that are barred under 47 U.S.C. § 
1404 from participating in auctions.104  We seek comment on this proposal and whether eligibility should 
be more restricted.  We further seek comment on how, in this context, we interpret section 310(b), which 
imposes restrictions on who can hold or be granted a “broadcast or common carrier or aeronautical en 
route or aeronautical fixed radio station license.”105  Under the various authorization proposals discussed 
herein, would a licensee be considered as holding a “common carrier[,] aeronautical en route or 
102 The standard document RTCA DO-377A appears to endorse further consideration, to the extent permitted under 
the relevant spectrum allocation, of permitting networks (as opposed to direct links) to provide both CNPC and 
payload if the relevant spectrum allocations support both, stating that “if a UAS designer selects . . . (a) a C2 Link 
System architecture that relies on external entities to provide the communication link, e.g., networked terrestrial 
radios or SATCOM and (b) there is sufficient bandwidth in the link, it may be beneficial to use a single link to 
transmit both C2 and payload information; provided that the link is able to ensure the safety and priority of C2 
information over that associated with the payload(s).”  See RTCA, Minimum Aviation System Performance 
Standards for C2 Link Systems Supporting Operations of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in U.S. Airspace, RTCA DO-
377A (2021) (RTCA DO-377A), Appx. A, at A.6.3; see also RTCA DO-377A, Appx. J (“Command and Control 
and Payload on Same Link”), at J.1 (providing “information related to using a common, or shared, link to support 
both Command and Control (C2) and payload information exchanges.”) (emphasis in original).
103 See 47 U.S.C. § 303(y).  Specifically, the provision provides that the Commission has authority to “allocate 
electromagnetic spectrum so as to provide flexibility of use” if (1) such use is consistent with international 
agreements to which the United States is a party; (2) such use would not deter investment in communications 
services and systems, or technology development; and (3) such use would not result in harmful interference among 
users.  Id.
104 See 47 U.S.C. § 310; id. § 1404; see also 47 CFR § 96.5 (applying similar restrictions to Priority Access 
Licensees in the 3.5 GHz band).
105 See 47 U.S.C. § 310(b).  Section 310(b) provides that these types of licenses may not be granted to or held by 
aliens, representatives of aliens, foreign corporations or corporations with specified levels of foreign ownership.  Id.
497Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
aeronautical fixed radio station license”?106  If so, how should we evaluate any foreign-ownership 
holdings?
54. We also seek comment on whether to provide that any entity is eligible to operate NNA 
stations using assignments from a DFMS other than those precluded by section 310 from holding station 
licenses.  Given our proposal elsewhere to license NNA stations by rule, we seek comment on whether 
section 310 ownership restrictions, which apply to “station licenses,” apply to operators of stations 
licensed by rule.  We further seek comment, if section 310 does not apply to operators of licensed-by-rule 
stations, on whether NNA station operators, or the parties receiving assignments from a DFMS for such 
operation, should be subject to eligibility restrictions comparable to those imposed by section 310 on 
station licensees.
55. NTIA recommends that, to be eligible for a license for 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations, 
an applicant be required to certify that it has the requisite FAA remote pilot certification or, in the case of 
an organization, to certify that it will only utilize individuals with this qualification for its UAS operations 
in the band.107  Compliance by 5030-5091 MHz operators with applicable FAA remote pilot regulations 
will be critical to the safe operation of UAS in the 5030-5091 MHz band, and we seek comment on the 
best approach to achieve this goal, and on NTIA’s proposal as one option.  To the extent that we adopt a 
licensed-by-rule model for NNA as proposed, however, UAS operators will not be required to submit 
individual license applications, and accordingly, there will be no individual license applications in which 
UAS operators could make the proposed certifications.108  Further, provision of network-based NSS 
would likely involve a network provider’s provision of CNPC services to other entities, and thus, it is 
likely the relevant UAS operator will be neither a licensee nor an employee of a licensee.  Accordingly, 
we seek comment on whether requiring license applicants to certify that they have the requisite FAA 
remote pilot certification or will utilize operators with such qualifications is a practical option in either the 
NNA or NSS context.
56. We further seek comment on the costs and benefits of conditioning either NNA or NSS 
eligibility on a certification that the party has the necessary FAA remote pilot certification or compliance 
with other FAA requirements.  We seek comment on whether it provides a significant regulatory benefit 
to specifically limit eligibility in this manner, given that UAS operators using 5030-5091 MHz spectrum 
will in any case be subject directly to FAA rules and enforcement and would not be able to lawfully 
operate unless they comply with all applicable FAA requirements.  We also seek comment on any 
administrative concerns from having the Commission potentially be required to interpret and enforce the 
regulatory regime of another agency.  Although Boeing supports such incorporation, it notes that “the 
FAA is still working to develop a remote pilot certification program for operators of large UAS.”109  
CTIA similarly notes that “FAA rules and regulations are evolving and it is unclear at this juncture what 
kind of certification, if any, the FAA will require for different types of UAS users.”110  Does the varied 
and evolving nature of these requirements further argue against importing them into the Commission’s 
licensing regime?
106 47 U.S.C. § 310(b).  
107 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 3; see also, e.g., EEI Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 (arguing that, to address 
public safety and security issues, the licensing framework should ensure that individual operators of CNPC links are 
properly qualified); Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 3 (arguing that license eligibility should be conditioned on 
operator’s ability to meet FAA safety and performance requirements).
108 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 6 (arguing against license eligibility requirements if stations will be licensed 
by rule); see also Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 5 (arguing that a license applicant certification that they have the 
requisite FAA remote pilot certification would be a helpful precaution only “to the extent the Commission proposes 
a licensing model that includes individual licensing of UAS operators”).

498Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
57. To the extent that there should be some mechanism in addition to the FAA’s enforcement 
authority to adequately ensure that use of the 5030-5091 MHz band will be consistent with FAA 
requirements, we seek comment on whether we can instead rely on the DFMS and NSS licensees to 
ensure that UAS operators have the necessary FAA approvals.  For example, to address NNA users, users 
registering with a DFMS could be required to make the requisite certification as a condition of 
registration.  Alternatively, we might impose a more general requirement on a DFMS to adopt measures 
that reasonably ensure that operators have the requisite FAA remote pilot authority, and defer to the 
DFMS administrator (or a multi-stakeholder group) on specific mechanisms to implement this 
requirement.  We seek comment on these and other alternatives.
6. Non-Networked Access (NNA) Service Rules
58.Licensing rules.  We seek comment on the licensing regime or mechanism we should 
adopt to enable authorization of NNA operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and the costs and benefits 
of any proposed approach.  Because we anticipate a large number of operators seeking temporary use of 
the band, with an even greater number of ground and aircraft stations, we propose to reduce the 
administrative burdens on such operators and the Commission by adopting a licensing approach that 
would not require individual licensing of these numerous operators and/or stations.  Specifically, we 
propose to implement a licensed-by-rule authorization for aircraft and ground stations in the band, as 
recommended by AIA and others.111  Under this framework, operators would not be required to apply for 
individual spectrum licenses for themselves or their mobile or ground stations in order to conduct NNA 
operations in the band.  Instead, parties using rule-compliant stations and operating in compliance with 
the rules would only need to obtain the requisite temporary frequency assignment from the DFMS in 
order to transmit in the band in the requested location, frequency, and timeframe.  We further propose to 
permit the stations used by the operator on the ground to send and receive signals to the UA to be either 
fixed stations or mobile stations (such as hand-held controllers).112  We seek comment, however, on 
whether to require all NNA ground stations in the band to be fixed stations, and on the costs and benefits 
of permitting the use of mobile ground stations.  To what extent would prohibiting such stations facilitate 
coordination in the NNA portion of the band, or reduce the likelihood of harmful interference, failures to 
comply with assignments, or challenges with administering or policing the system?  If we do not permit 
mobile ground stations, should we differentiate “portable” stations, i.e., stations that can be moved but are 
not intended to be used while in motion?
59. Section 307(e) of the Act authorizes the Commission to adopt a licensed-by-rule 
approach for certain specific categories of services, including the “citizens band radio service,” and also 
expressly delegates to the Commission the discretion to define the scope of the term “citizens band radio 
service.”113  In the Commission’s rules, the citizens band radio service is defined as “any radio service or 
other specific classification of radio stations used primarily for wireless telecommunications for which the 
FCC has determined that it serves the public interest, convenience and necessity to authorize by rule the 
operation of radio stations in that service or class, without individual licenses, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 
111 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 5-6 (proposing a framework under which the “pilot/operator would not be the 
spectrum license holder” and stations would be licensed by rule to use channels assigned on a flight-by-flight basis); 
id. at 13; Qualcomm Refresh PN Comments at 8; Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 3.
112 As used in this NPRM, the term “mobile station” refers to a station “intended to be used while in motion or 
during halts at unspecified points.”  47 CFR § 87.5 (mobile service); accord 47 CFR § 2.1 (defining “mobile 
station” as “[a] station in the mobile service intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified 
points”); see 47 U.S.C. § 153(34) (“The term ‘mobile station’ means a radio-communication station capable of being 
moved and which ordinarily does move.”).
113 47 U.S.C. § 307(e)(1), (e)(3).  The authority provides an exception to the statutory requirement under section 308 
of the Act that, aside from cases of emergencies, the Commission may grant station licenses “only upon written 
application . . . .”  Id. § 308(a).
499Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
307(e)(1).”114  Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has provided for licensing by rule of an array of 
services through inclusion in the citizens band radio service, including the Family Radio Service, the Low 
Power Radio Service, the Medical Device Radiocommunication Service, the Wireless Medical Telemetry 
Service, the Dedicated Short-Range Communications Service On-Board Units, and the Part 96 General 
Authorized Access tier of the 3.5 GHz band.115  We tentatively find that licensing by rule of NNA stations 
would serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity, and accordingly, we propose to implement 
licensing by rule by including NNA within the scope of the citizens band radio service.116  We seek 
comment on our tentative conclusion and proposal, on the scope of our authority under Section 307(e) to 
adopt a licensed-by-rule approach to UAS operations, and on alternative licensing approaches we might 
adopt that would not require individual licensing of operators or stations in the band.
60. Section 307(e)(1) also expressly authorizes licensing by rule in “the aviation radio service 
for aircraft stations” but does not provide an equivalent grant of authority to adopt licensing by rule for 
aviation service ground stations.117  We seek comment on whether we nevertheless have authority in this 
case to adopt licensing by rule for both aircraft and ground stations in the aviation service.  Section 
307(e)(3) provides the Commission authority to define “aircraft station” for purposes of section 307(e).  
We seek comment on whether this provision provides us the authority to define “aircraft station” to 
include UAS ground stations and whether such an action would serve the public interest.
61.Technical requirements.  We seek comment on appropriate technical requirements to 
govern 5030-5091 MHz NNA equipment and operations.  In the current record, NTIA, AIA, and many 
other parties support adoption of the technical requirements in the RTCA DO-362A standard for this 
purpose.118  RTCA DO-362A contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS) for 
terrestrial-based (i.e., non-satellite) CNPC point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links in the 5030-5091 
MHz band, including power limits, emission limits, and frequency accuracy requirements.119  The FAA 
recently issued a Technical Standard Order (TSO) establishing minimum performance standards in the 
5030-5091 MHz band based on requirements in RTCA DO-362A.120  Accordingly, and in consideration 
of the current record, we propose to adopt the RTCA DO-362A standard or technical requirements based 
on that standard to govern NNA equipment and operations and seek comment on this proposal.121  We

115 See 3.5 GHz R&O, 30 FCC Rcd at 4011, paras. 159-61.
116 We note that, while most services that fall under the citizens band radio service category are included in part 95 
of the Commission’s rules, the rules for 3.5 GHz General Authorized Access (GAA) stations, which are licensed by 
rule, are located in part 96.  See 47 CFR § 96.1(b).

Comments at 2.
119 See RTCA DO-362A §§ 1.1, 1.1.2, 1.4; see also id. at Executive Summary.  Formally, RTCA DO-362A provides 
the standards for “CNPC Link Systems,” which are defined as “[t]he combination of airborne and ground UAS 
radios, antennas, and cabling between them that support the data and information exchanges between the UA and the 
[control station] for the purposes of managing and controlling the flight and operation of a UA.”  Id. §§ 1.4, 1.9.
120 See TSO-C213a; see also supra n.19; Boeing Refresh PN Comments at 6 (stating that “radios that comply with 
FAA Technical Standard Order . . . requirements, likely based on RTCA DO-362, will be necessary to ensure 
aviation safety under the AM(R)S service.”).       
121 See RTCA DO-362A.  We note that RTCA SC-228 has been working on a revision of the standard, to be 
designated DO-362B.  See RTCA Special Committee 228, Terms of Reference, Minimum Performance Standards 
for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, 5 (June 23, 2022), https://www.rtca.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SC-228-TOR-
Rev-15-Approved-2022-06-23.pdf (SC-228 June 2022 Terms of Reference).  Below, we seek comment on 
streamlining the process by which the Commission’s rules can be updated to reflect such a revision.  See infra para. 
74. 
500Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
seek comment on the adequacy of the RTCA DO-362A specified equipment and operational performance 
requirements, including both transmitter power and receiver input power, and required minimum coupling 
loss (separation distance) between ground and airborne CNPC radios and emissions from other licensed 
radio services.122 
62. We seek comment on an appropriate measure of CNPC link reliability to assess RTCA 
DO-362A and other standards, on the specific anticipated level of CNPC link reliability through radios 
compliant with the RTCA DO-362A standard, and on any available data that confirms that reliability.  We 
note that some parties have already constructed 5030-5091 MHz UAS radios compliant with RTCA DO-
362 and some have also obtained experimental license authorization from the Commission for their 
operation in the 5030-5091 MHz band.123  We seek comment on any current or past operation of 
equipment compliant with RTCA DO-362 or RTCA DO-362A, on the results of any such operations, and 
on the extent to which they support or raise issues or concerns about incorporation of the standard as the 
governing technical framework for the 5030-5091 MHz band.  We also seek comment on whether parties 
have deployed experimental UAS equipment in the 5030-5091 MHz band in reliance on any other 
technical standard.  Is there any benefit to requiring formal experimental trials or testing for 5030-5091 
MHz band equipment?     
63. We also seek comment on any costs or disadvantages in imposing the RTCA DO-362A 
standard.  For example, we seek comment on whether and to what extent imposition of this standard may 
limit the scope of UAS operations that can make use of links in the band.  We also seek comment on 
whether any such limitations are a result of hard constraints codified in the standard on the scope of UAS 
operations that may occur consistent with the standard specifications, or instead are a consequence of 
practical constraints, such as if the standard requires the development and installation of radio equipment 
that may be too heavy for some UA to carry.  For example, the standard provides the standards for CNPC 
Link Systems, which are limited to communications between a UA and a control station.124  We seek 
comment on whether application of the standard to the band would preclude use of the band for UA-to-
UA or broadcast transmissions for purposes such as DAA or Remote ID.  Or would transmissions such as 
Remote ID broadcasts be compatible with communications between ground stations and aircraft so long 
as the broadcast transmissions complied with the requirements of section 2.2.1 of RTCA DO-362A that 
are applicable to aircraft stations?125  Some have also asserted that application of the standard may restrict 
permissible operations to flights transitioning in and out of Class A airspace.126  We seek comment on the 
extent to which requiring compliance with RTCA DO-362A would strictly or effectively limit operations 
in this manner. 
64. Canada states that some technical incompatibilities have been identified between RTCA 
DO-362A and a proposed standard by the European Organization for Civil Aviation Equipment 
122 We note that the Commission has recently issued a Notice of Inquiry regarding potential measures that may 
promote improvements in receiver performance.  See Promoting Efficient Use of Spectrum through Improved 
Receiver Interference Immunity Performance, ET Docket No. 22-137, Notice of Inquiry, FCC 22-29 (Apr. 21, 
2022).  Comments regarding UAS-related receiver performance may also be submitted in that docket.  
123 See, e.g., L3H Refresh PN Comments at 7 (stating that certain requirements of the standard were “successfully 
demonstrated in prototype CNPC C Band radios”); uAvionix Refresh PN Comments at 1 (stating that uAvionix has 
obtained experimental licenses for 5030-5091 MHz band radio development in two locations, Bigfork, Montana, and 
Grand Forks, North Dakota, and that (as of October 12, 2021) flight tests had already begun at Bigfork using radios 
designed to comply with RTCA DO-362A).
124 See RTCA DO-362A, § 1.2 (“[T]his CNPC Link System MOPS document addresses only the CNPC Link 
System, which is part of a larger system that seeks to exchange information between a UA and its Control Station”).

(EUROCAE) for satellite-based CNPC in the same band, designated draft ED-265, and asserts that 
adoption of the RTCA DO-362A standard without addressing the incompatibilities may create difficulties 
in managing the operation of CNPC links in support of international UAS operations.127  We seek 
comment on these concerns, the nature of the incompatibilities, and what, if any, measures, requirements, 
or restrictions are necessary to address them.128  We note that RTCA has been considering the “ED-
265/DO-362 interference issue.”129  We seek comment on any determinations that have been made 
regarding these incompatibilities and whether the issue is adequately addressed in the current RTCA DO-
362A version of the standard or will be addressed in a future version.  If revisions to RTCA DO-362A are 
necessary or appropriate to address these issues, we seek comment on whether the next version of the 
standard is anticipated to be backwardly compatible with RTCA DO-362A, and if not, whether adoption 
of final rules should be deferred until these issues are resolved in a new version of the standard.  We seek 
comment on whether any coordination or other requirements are necessary to ensure adequate protection 
of foreign satellite-based CNPC services in the band, particularly insofar as they may operate near United 
States jurisdictional boundaries.  We also note that footnote 5.443C of the Table of Frequency Allocations 
limits the use of the 5030-5091 MHz band to “internationally standardized aeronautical systems.”130  We 
seek comment on whether this provision requires the Commission to adopt a standard that is compatible 
with the EUROCAE standard, and whether RTCA DO-362A would meet our obligations under footnote 
5.443C.  
65. If we incorporate the RTCA DO-362A standard into our rules, we seek comment on 
whether to do so through adoption of a general requirement that, to be certified for use under or operated 
under the NNA rules, all radio equipment must comply with the requirements of RTCA DO-362A, rather 
than to separately incorporate the various technical requirements of RTCA DO-362A (e.g., power, 
frequency stability, and emission limitations) into the service rules.131  If we adopt a general requirement 
to comply with RTCA DO-362A, we propose to also separately codify requirements for power and 
emission bandwidth based on the RTCA DO-362A standard, to provide clarity and ease of reference in 
the rules.132  If, alternatively, we do not have a requirement of general compliance with RTCA DO-362A, 
but require compliance with only selected provisions of the standard, which provisions or requirements 
from RTCA DO-362A should we impose?  Which specific provisions of RTCA DO-362A are necessary 
for compatible use of the 5030-5091 MHz band?  Should the Commission’s technical framework require 
compliance more broadly with section 2, the Equipment Performance Requirements and Test Procedures 
127 See Canada Refresh PN Comments at 1; see also EUROCAE Open Consultation, ED-265, 
https://www.eurocae.net/news/posts/2019/may/eurocae-open-consultation-ed-265/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022).
128 While Canada does not describe the nature of the incompatibility to which it refers, and no other commenter 
discusses incompatibilities between the RTCA DO-362A standard and the EUROCAE standard, discussions before 
ICAO have focused on the difference in TDD time frames between the two standards; RTCA DO-362A terrestrial 
links relies on a 50 ms time frame to minimize latency, while the satellite-based links under ED-265 would use a 
300 ms time frame.  See, e.g., ICAO, C2 Link 5 GHz Band Planning – Status Update – RPAS Panel WG2, at 3-4

applicable to the link system radios, or both sections 2 and 3, the latter of which includes performance 
standards for the link system when installed in a UA and ground location?133  Alternatively, is it 
sufficient, for purposes of establishing the baseline technical framework, to require compliance with the 
specific frequency capture range (which includes a frequency accuracy standard), power limits, and 
emission limits stipulated by the standard?134  
66. RTCA states that emission limit requirements should also require equipment compliance 
with the 50 ms Time Division Duplex (TDD) requirements specified under section 2.2.1.3 of the 
standard.135  It asserts that use of non-TDD systems or TDD systems with different time length frames 
operating in the 5030-5091 MHz band within the same radio horizon as RTCA DO-362A compliant 
equipment will cause unacceptable levels of interference.136  We seek comment on RTCA’s assertion and 
recommendation, and whether adoption of the standard for NNA will necessarily require all equipment in 
the band, including equipment in neighboring NSS blocks, to use RTCA DO-362A compliant TDD 
equipment to avoid harmful interference to NNA operations.  
67. We seek comment on whether any of the general technical requirements in subpart D of 
part 87 should apply to NNA equipment.  NTIA proposes, for example, that in addition to meeting the 
out-of-band emissions limits in RTCA DO-362A, we should also require equipment to meet the out-of-
band emissions limit specified in section 87.139(c).137  RTCA argues, however, that the current 
requirements of section 87.139(c) are less stringent than those in RTCA DO-362A, and that the 
Commission should just require compliance with the latter.138  L3H asserts that it is not clear whether 
section 87.139 is applicable, as it applies only to communications using certain specific Emissions 
Designators and the RTCA DO-362A mandatory modulation makes no reference to these designators.139  
We seek comment on NTIA’s proposal, on whether section 87.139(c) may, under its existing terms, apply 
to UAS communications anticipated in the 5030-5091 MHz band, and whether such application is in the 
public interest.  We further seek comment on whether we need to specify authorized emission classes and 
133 See RTCA DO-362A, §§ 2, 3.  Section 3 requirements are imposed out of recognition that “[s]ome CNPC Link 
System attributes and performance may be affected by factors resulting from integration into the UAS.”  RTCA DO-
362A, § 3.  
134 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 2; RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 6; see also RTCA DO-362A §§ 2.2.1.4 
(frequency capture range), 2.2.1.6.1 (power limits), 2.2.1.6.2 (emission/output power spectral density limits).  RTCA 
flags the section 2.2.1.6 power and emission limits (stating that these requirements have been made “more stringent” 
than in the original RTCA DO-362 standard) but recommends we require compliance with transmitter EIRP and 
EIRP spectral density emissions requirements under section 3.2.1.42.  See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 6.   
135 See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 6.  See also AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 (supporting a requirement that 
transmitters comply with the 50 ms TDD requirements of RTCA DO-362A § 2.2.1.3).
136 See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 6.
137 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 2.  Section 87.139(c) of the Commission’s rules provides that “[f]or aircraft 
station transmitters first installed after February 1, 1983, and for aeronautical station transmitters in use after 
February 1, 1983, and using H2B, H3E, J3E, J7B or J9W, the peak envelope power of any emissions must be 
attenuated below the peak envelope power of the transmitter (pX) as follows: (1) When the frequency is removed 
from the assigned frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 150 percent of the authorized bandwidth 
of 3.0 kHz, the attenuation must be at least 30 dB.  (2) When the frequency is removed from the assigned frequency 
by more than 150 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth of 3.0 kHz, the attenuation 
must be at least 38 dB.  (3) When the frequency is removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent 
of the authorized bandwidth of 3.0 kHz for aircraft transmitters the attenuation must be at least 43 dB.  For 
aeronautical station transmitters with transmitter power up to and including 50 watts the attenuation must be at least 
43 + 10log 10 pX dB and with transmitter power more than 50 watts the attenuation must be at least 60 dB.”  47 CFR

designators for this service, such as has been done with aviation services.140  If so, we seek comment on 
what classes and designators are appropriate, and whether we should use one of the types of assignable 
emissions already defined in, for example, section 87.137 of the rules.141  We propose emission 
designators of G8D for data and G8F for video and seek comment on their appropriateness for operations 
subject to RTCA DO-362A.142  
68. We seek comment on any other requirements we should impose on NNA equipment.  For 
example, what requirements should we adopt to facilitate a DFMS’s ability to communicate with or 
otherwise control such equipment in the execution of the DFMS’s responsibilities?  Should equipment be 
required to enable the DFMS to make direct (machine-to-machine) frequency assignments to the UAS 
equipment, in order to ensure that assignments are accurately programmed?  Should this capability be 
available at all times, or only pre-flight?  To the extent DFMS communications or control signals are 
intended to affect operating parameters of the UA, should such communications or control signals be 
required to occur exclusively through communications between the DFMS and the relevant ground 
control station or stations, rather than through direct communications with a UA station?  In the 3.5 GHz 
band, fixed stations must respond automatically to SAS directions to modify certain operational 
parameters such as frequency or power limit.143  Should requirements be adopted for NNA equipment to 
provide the DFMS with similar control?  We further seek comment on whether to impose requirements to 
ensure interoperability between NNA and NSS network services.  Potentially, UA flights that initially 
rely on a network service may extend into areas where no network has been deployed.  What 
requirements, if any, should we adopt to facilitate operations that can seamlessly switch between network 
service for CNPC and NNA assignments for that purpose?  
69. We note that RTCA has also adopted another standard applicable to CNPC in the 5030-
5091 MHz band, designated RTCA DO-377A, Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for C2 
Link Systems Supporting Operations of Unmanned Aircraft Systems in U.S. Airspace (RTCA 
DO-377A).144  Whereas RTCA DO-362A describes minimum performance standards for the ground and 
airborne radios used for a direct link, focusing on certain design characteristics of these radios such as 
power and emissions limits, RTCA DO-377A describes the minimum performance of an overall “C2 Link 
System,” defined as a system used to send information exchanges between a control station and an 
unmanned aircraft and to manage the connection between them, and which can be comprised of one or 
many Air/Ground links and Ground/Ground links.145  RTCA DO-377A can be applied to systems relying 
on a direct connection or systems relying on network functionality for the connection, and focuses on 
system requirements, including system performance, safety, and security requirements.146  To the extent 
that RTCA DO-377A applies to NNA operations, we seek comment on whether we should adopt rules 
140 See 47 CFR § 87.131.
141 See 47 CFR § 87.137 (providing the assignable emissions for part 87 services and corresponding emission 
designators and authorized bandwidths).

standard, RTCA DO-377.

applied to any C2 Link System, we note that commenters in this proceeding have generally described the 
requirements of RTCA DO-377A in the context of network-based CNPC.  See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 6 
(asserting that network providers of CNPC must “meet[] aviation performance levels and the safety requirements (in 
DO-377A) that govern a proposed network of [ground stations] and services”); id. at 8 (stating that RTCA DO-377A 
“guides the implementation of ground networks”); uAvionix Refresh PN Comments at 1; Wisk Refresh PN

requiring compliance with the standard.147  Alternatively, should we limit our requirements, as AIA 
recommends, to technical requirements based on RTCA DO-362A and leave system performance, safety, 
and security requirements, such as those in RTCA DO-377A, to be considered by a multi-stakeholder 
group or addressed by the FAA?148
70.Application of Part 87 Aviation Service Rules and Part 1 Wireless Radio Service Rules.  
We seek comment on where to locate the new NNA services rules within the organization of the 
Commission’s rules.  Some parties argue that the new service should be located in part 87,149 which 
“states the conditions under which radio stations may be licensed and used in the aviation services.”150  
We seek comment on this option.  We note, however, that the new services may not entirely fit within the 
scope of “aviation services,” which are defined as “[r]adio-communication services for the operation of 
aircraft.”151  For example, we seek comment above on whether to permit non-CNPC traffic, such as 
payload communications, which would be communications to achieve mission objectives and not for the 
“operation of aircraft.”  In addition, it may be appropriate to locate the new NNA and NSS service rules 
together, and we anticipate that NSS licenses will differ from traditional aviation services in a number of 
other ways.  For example, unlike licenses in traditional aviation services, we anticipate that NSS licenses 
will provide exclusive rights to spectrum.152  Further, we expect that NSS licenses will be used for the 
provision of commercial wireless network services and will therefore raise a number of issues more 
comparable to those involved in the regulation of commercial network services than the regulation of 
traditional aviation services, such as considerations of promoting service competition and network build-
out, as well as possible license auction issues.  In addition, the current part 87 rules were not adopted with 
UAS in mind, and many of the rules in part 87, even in sections otherwise generally applicable to part 87 
services, may be unnecessary or inappropriate to apply to UAS communications or to the 5030-5091 MHz 
services specifically.153  Locating the rules in a new rule part may therefore provide greater clarity and 
ease of reference in determining the rules applicable to the band.  Finally, locating the rules for the 5030-
5091 MHz band in a new rule part would not be inconsistent with its allocation for AM(R)S.  Whether or 
not the rules are in part 87, the band will remain protected aviation spectrum allocated for AM(R)S and 
rules under this allocation can be adopted to achieve the safety and reliability appropriate for 
147 While we do not anticipate that wide-area networks will be deployed in reliance on NNA assignments because of 
the highly transient nature of the relevant spectrum rights, we do not propose to prohibit operators from using their 
temporary assignments with fixed network infrastructure.  Potentially, parties might use these transient spectrum 
rights in connection with limited infrastructure deployment, such as a string of ground stations deployed over a 
particular and frequently used flight path.  We invite commenters to discuss whether and to what extent the 
minimum performance standards of RTCA DO-377A would apply in such cases.
148 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 8, 13-14 (advocating that “the basis of initial service rules” should be “found 
in RTCA DO-362A” and “aviation-specific requirements based on DO-377A should be developed “by members of 
the UAS standards-making community”); WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 3 (advocating that the Commission 
establish rules with “the minimum necessary technical restrictions to provide adequate protection against harmful 
interference”).  Above, we address in further detail the potential reliance on a multi-stakeholder group to further 
develop recommendations or standards for DFMS and CNPC operation in the 5030-5091 MHz band.
149 See, e.g., AIA Petition at ii.
150 47 CFR § 87.1(b).
151 47 CFR § 87.5.
152 See 47 CFR § 87.41(b) (providing that frequencies are available for part 87 aviation services “on a shared basis 
only and will not be assigned for the exclusive use of any licensee”).
153 See, e.g., CTIA AIA Petition Comments at 15 (arguing that part 87 rules were “designed for manned aircraft,” 
that “there are critical differences among manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft,” including different risk 
considerations, that “regulations for each should be appropriate,” and that a new rule part for UAS would be “more 
workable than attempting to retrofit rules intended for manned aviation to accommodate UAS.”) (emphasis in 
original).  We seek comment below on the extent to which the substance of specific part 87 requirements should be 
applied to NNA operations.  
505Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
communications “relating to the safety and regularity of flight,” regardless of where the rules are 
located.154  Accordingly, we seek comment on whether we should locate the new UAS rules in a new rule 
part rather than in part 87, as reflected in Appendix A.155  We further seek comment on alternative options 
for the appropriate home for the new rules.   
71. Whether we locate the rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band in part 87, a new rule part, or 
elsewhere, we seek comment on whether and to what extent the generally applicable rules in subparts B 
through F of part 87 should apply to or be incorporated into the new NNA service, either in their current 
form or with modifications.156  We ask commenters that argue for application of these general part 87 
rules to be specific as to which provisions they recommend should be applied, and what, if any, 
modifications they propose.  We anticipate that many of these provisions will be unnecessary, superseded, 
or otherwise inappropriate as a result of the specific requirements we adopt for the new service.  For 
example, section 87.41 (Frequencies) in subpart B provides rules for the request and coordination of 
specific frequencies.  Given the proposal for frequency management by a DFMS, is this provision entirely 
superseded, or is there an aspect of this provision that should apply to NNA assignments?  
72. As another example, section 87.89 requires that, with certain exceptions, operators of 
licensed aviation service stations “must hold a commercial radio operator license or permit.”157  The 
operator license requirement is distinct from and wholly independent of the requirement that each station 
be licensed and requires individuals seeking an operator license to demonstrate, by passing a formal 
examination, sufficient knowledge of the relevant radio technologies.158  The operator license requirement 
stems from section 318 of the Act, which requires operators of transmitting equipment of licensed stations 
to hold an operator’s license, except where the Commission finds that the public interest, convenience, or 
necessity will be served by waiving such requirement.159  Some parties in the record have suggested that 
the Commission adopt operator license requirements for all UAS operators that use 5030-5091 MHz radio 
equipment, or at least impose the equivalent knowledge requirements on such operators.160  Others have 
argued against such a requirement.  For example, some assert that the Commission should defer to the 
FAA as the expert agency over aircraft pilot qualifications and rely on the FAA’s regulations establishing 
the testing and certification of UAS operators instead of establishing its own UAS operator licensing or 
154 See 47 CFR § 2.1 (definition of AM(R)S).
155 See supra Appx. A.
156 See 47 CFR pt. 87, subpts. B (Applications and Licenses), C (Operating Requirements and Procedures), D 
(Technical Requirements), E (Frequencies), F (Aircraft Stations).  Above, we discuss in greater detail possible 
technical requirements, including possible application of the general part 87 technical provisions in subpart D.

https://www.fcc.gov/commercial-radio-operator-license-program (last visited Sept. 6, 2022) (“FCC rules require that 
licensees of [aviation service] stations permit only persons holding the appropriate FCC-issued commercial operator 
license to perform specified transmitter operation, maintenance and repair duties.”).  We note that this part 87 
requirement is subject to the general waiver of the operator license requirement for subscribers of a Wireless Radio 
Service.  See 47 CFR § 1.903(c); see also id. § 1.907 (providing that part 1 Wireless Radio Services include, inter 
alia, part 87 services).  Given that NNA assignments are intended to provide operators with direct access to 
spectrum, however, it appears unlikely that many UAS operators that rely on NNA assignments will be doing so as 
subscribers of a Wireless Radio Service.

permit requirement.161  Some also suggest that requiring all operations to be performed by licensed UAS 
operators might unintentionally prohibit autonomous UAS operations that do not require human 
operators.162  We seek comment on whether, in addition to the station license (which, as discussed, we 
propose to provide through licensing by rule), we should require UAS operators using a NNA assignment 
in the 5030-5091 MHz band to have an individual operator license.  Conversely, would it be in the public 
interest to forgo any such operator licensing or permitting requirements as unnecessary or inappropriate in 
light of FAA regulation of and authority over UAS remote pilot qualifications, or for other reasons?
73. We also seek comment on whether the new service should be subject to rules under part 
1, subpart F governing “Wireless Radio Service” applications and proceedings.163  The “Wireless Radio 
Services” are already defined to include licensed-by-rule services such as those under parts 95 and 96, as 
well as public and private part 87 aviation services, although not all of these subpart F provisions apply to 
licensed-by-rule services, such as those requirements governing license applications.164  Accordingly, we 
seek comment on whether NNA services, even if licensed by rule, should be included in and subject to the 
subpart F rules for Wireless Radio Services to the same extent as other licensed-by-rule services.     
74.Streamlined procedures to update incorporated standards.  We anticipate that any 
technical standard developed by a standards organization that we incorporate by reference into our rules 
will be subject to ongoing revisions as parties gain more experience and the UAS industry continues to 
rapidly evolve.  For example, RTCA DO-362A, which we consider above, is a 2020 revision of the 
RTCA DO-362 standard issued by RTCA in 2016, and RTCA Special Committee 228 (SC-228) is 
already working on a second revision.165  Accordingly, we anticipate that the rules will need to be 
revisited in the future to reflect important and beneficial standard updates.  In the past, the Commission 
has found it in the public interest to streamline the process for incorporating updates to a previously 
adopted standard, by delegating rulemaking authority to one or more Bureaus for this purpose.166  To help 
ensure that the rules for 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations continue to reflect the most current version of 
any incorporated standard for 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations, we invite comment on whether we 
should adopt a comparable delegation of rulemaking authority in this case.  Specifically, we seek 
comment on whether to delegate joint rulemaking authority to WTB and OET to incorporate into the 
Commission’s rules, after consultation with the FAA and NTIA, and notice and an opportunity for public 
comment, any updated version of a previously incorporated technical standard applicable to UAS 
161 See CTIA AIA Petition Comments at 19-20; Small UAV Coalition AIA Petition Comments at 7.
162 See Small UAV Coalition AIA Petition Comments at 6.
163 See 47 CFR pt. 1, subpt. F (Wireless Radio Services Applications and Proceedings).  The term “Wireless Radio 
Services” or WRS is defined as “[a]ll radio services authorized in parts 13, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 74, 80, 87, 90, 95, 
96, 97 and 101 of this chapter, whether commercial or private in nature.”  47 CFR § 1.907.  Thus, WRS is an

operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band.167  Similar to limitations the Commission has placed in some 
earlier delegations of rulemaking authority to update standards, should we limit this delegated authority to 
the incorporation of standard updates that do not raise major compliance issues?168    
7. Network Supported Service (NSS) Service Rules
75. We seek comment on the license terms and service rules we should adopt for NSS 
licenses.  We seek comment in particular on issuing exclusive use, geographic area defined licenses for a 
specific term of years, with rights of renewal, subject to specific performance (network coverage) 
obligations.  We seek comment on appropriate technical and operational requirements and on the 
assignment process rules.   
76.Geographic area licenses.  Consistent with our approach in several other bands that has 
promoted the deployment of wide area networks for a variety of fixed and mobile services,169 we propose 
to license NSS spectrum blocks in the 5030-5091 MHz band for exclusive use on a geographic area basis.  
Geographic area licensing provides certainty to licensees and promotes efficient spectrum use, among 
other things, and will give licensees siting flexibility that will promote the deployment of wide area 
networks in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  Geographic area licensing will also help to facilitate rapid 
assignment of licenses, utilizing competitive bidding when mutually exclusive applications are 
received.170  We seek comment on this approach, on its costs and benefits, and on alternative licensing 
approaches.  If a party opposes using geographic licensing, it should explain its position, describe the 
licensing scheme it supports, and identify the costs and benefits associated with its alternative licensing 
proposal.   
77. We further seek comment on the appropriate geographic license area or areas for NSS 
licenses to support NSS UAS operations and facilitate investment, including investment by small entities, 
and robust spectrum use.  We seek comment on whether we should adopt larger license areas such as 
Regional Economic Area Groupings (REAG) or nationwide markets to facilitate NSS uses that may often 
involve flight over long distances, adopt a more granular scheme such as Partial Economic Areas (PEA), 
which would provide more flexibility to serve a smaller area but still permit parties to achieve a larger 
area through aggregation, or adopt a mix of large and small license areas for different spectrum blocks.171  
While NTIA supports licensing by REAG, AIA argues in its Refresh PN comments that license areas 
corresponding to the Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) areas or other areas “that make sense in 
an aviation system context” would be appropriate, and Wisk similarly recommends use of the ARTCC 
areas to provide “alignment with a general air traffic density basis.”172  We seek comment on whether to

adopt license areas based on a geographic area division of the country that has been developed 
specifically for aviation purposes, such as the ARTCC areas.
78.License term.  We propose to issue NSS licenses for an initial 15-year term.  AIA and 
Wisk both support a license term “longer than 10 years,”173 and we believe that circumstances in the band, 
including the need to set up a DFMS in the band and integrate its functions with operations in NSS 
spectrum, as well as the nascent stage of standards development and other technical work regarding NSS 
networks generally, favor the use of a longer initial license term.  We propose to limit subsequent terms to 
10 years.  We seek comment on these proposals. 
79.Performance (network build-out or coverage) requirements.  The Commission also 
generally establishes build-out or coverage requirements for licenses, referred to as performance 
requirements, to ensure that spectrum is intensely and efficiently used and as mandated by the Act for 
auctioned spectrum.174  We seek comment on performance requirements that are appropriate for NSS 
licensees and UAS operation.  We seek comment in particular on whether to adopt a population-based 
performance metric, such as a requirement to cover at least 80 percent of the population in the license 
area within 12 years of the grant of the license, as the Commission recently adopted for geographic 
licenses in other bands.175  We also seek comment on whether to adopt an appropriate interim 
performance requirement, such as a requirement to cover at least 45 percent of the population in the 
license area within six years of license grant.176
80. While some parties support population-based coverage requirements for NSS licensees,177 
AIA argues that population is not an appropriate benchmark in this context, because “the spectrum will be 
used by aircraft rather than people on the ground,” including for “crop examination, border surveillance, 
and travel over sparsely populated areas[.]”178  AIA argues that such uses require reliable control links for 
all geographic areas of flight regardless of proximity to population centers, and suggests that a build-out 
requirement based on “user demand, special diversity and signal strength” would better meet the needs of 
beyond-radio-line-of-sight UAS operations.179  We seek comment on AIA’s arguments, and on whether 
operating on an Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) Flight Plan in controlled airspace, principally during the “en route” 
phase of the flight.  See Air Route Traffic Control Center, https://www.cfinotebook.net/notebook/air-traffic-

some parties within the aviation community use the term “performance requirements” to refer to a particular 
minimum technical or operational standard of performance.  See, e.g., AIA Refresh PN Comments at 14.  We do not 
seek comment on such requirements here; rather, we use “performance requirements” as the Commission has 
customarily used it, to refer to deadlines on licensees for meeting certain deployment or coverage milestones.

we should either require licensees to meet some criteria other than population, such as geographic area 
coverage of 25% of the license area at year six and 50% of the license area at year 12.180  Alternatively, 
should we provide licensees with the option of meeting either a population-based requirement or some 
alternative?  To the extent commenters recommend alternative build-out requirements, we ask them to 
propose either specific numerical benchmarks or other specific and objectively verifiable buildout criteria.  
81. We seek comment on appropriate rules for compliance demonstration and enforcement.  
As for compliance demonstration, we propose to adopt a process similar to compliance rules applicable to 
part 27 licensees, requiring a demonstration of compliance with the performance requirements by filing a 
construction notification with the Commission within 15 days of the expiration of the applicable 
benchmark, including electronic coverage maps accurately depicting the boundaries of the licensed area 
and the boundaries of the actual areas to which the licensee provides service.181  If a coverage map is used 
to demonstrate compliance, we seek comment on the appropriate standardized parameters for the 
propagation model.  For example, should there be standardized values for inputs such as cell edge 
probability, cell loading, and clutter?  As for enforcement, we propose that if a licensee fails to meet the 
final performance requirement, the license authorization will terminate automatically without specific 
Commission action.182  If we adopt an interim requirement, we propose that failure to meet the 
requirement would result in the reduction by two years of both the due date for the final performance 
requirement and the license term (resulting in a final performance requirement at year 10 and a license 
term of 13 years).183
82.License Renewal.  We seek comment on the appropriate standard for license renewal.  In 
the WRS Second R&O, the Commission adopted a unified regulatory framework for the Wireless Radio 
Services (WRS) that replaced the existing patchwork of service-specific rules regarding renewal with a 
single unified standard, and safe harbors for meeting that standard for different service categories, 
including a safe harbor for geographic licensees providing commercial service.184  We seek comment on 
whether the regulatory renewal framework for WRS commercial geographic licensees is appropriate for 
NSS licensees.  If we apply this framework, are there any special factors we need to account for or 
incorporate in the context of networks for support of UAS operations?   
83.Competitive bidding or other assignment procedures.  In the event that mutually 
exclusive license applications are received, we propose to assign these exclusive-use licenses through a 
system of competitive bidding.185  Consistent with the competitive bidding procedures the Commission 
has used in previous auctions, we propose to conduct any auction for geographic area licenses for 
spectrum in the band in conformity with the part 1, subpart Q general competitive bidding rules, subject

[its] private, internal communications needs.  See 47 CFR § 1.949(d).  The safe harbor for geographic licensees 
providing commercial service requires an applicant for renewal to demonstrate, in part, that it met its performance 
requirements and continues to provide service at least at the level required by its performance requirements.  See 47 
CFR § 1.949(e)(2), (3).

to any modification of the part 1 rules that the Commission may adopt in the future.186  We seek comment 
on whether any of these rules would be inappropriate or should be modified for an auction of licenses in 
this band.187  Our proposal to assign these licenses through competitive bidding assumes that Congress 
amends section 309(j)(1) of the Communications Act to extend the Commission’s authority to award 
licenses by competitive bidding.188  We seek comment on alternate assignment procedures in the event 
that the Commission’s statutory authority to auction licenses is not extended. 
84. If we provide for the assignment of these licenses through a system of competitive 
bidding, we also propose to make bidding credits for designated entities available for this band and seek 
comment on this proposal.  If we decide to offer small business bidding credits, we seek comment on how 
to define a small business.  In recent years, for other flexible-use licenses, we have adopted bidding 
credits for the two larger designated entity business sizes provided in the Commission’s part 1 
standardized schedule of bidding credits.189  We propose to use the same definitions here.190  Accordingly, 
we propose to define a small business as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five 
years not exceeding $55 million, and a very small business as an entity with average gross revenues for 
the preceding five years not exceeding $20 million.191  A qualifying “small business” would be eligible 
for a bidding credit of 15 percent and a qualifying “very small business” would be eligible for a bidding 
credit of 25 percent.192  We also seek comment on whether the aviation-safety purpose of the band, the 
characteristics of these frequencies, or any other factor suggest that we should not make available one or 
either of these designated entity bidding credits, or that we should adopt different small business size 
standards and associated bidding credits than we have in the past.  Finally, we seek comment on whether 
we should offer rural service providers a designated entity bidding credit for licenses in this band.  
Commenters addressing these proposals or advocating for any alternatives should consider what specific 
details of the licenses or operations in the band may affect whether designated entities will apply for them 
and whether designated entities should be supported by bidding credits.
186 See 47 CFR §§ 1.2101-1.2114.
187 Consistent with the statutory requirement and our longstanding approach, we propose to use a public notice 
process to solicit public input on certain details of auction design and the auction procedures.  See 47 U.S.C. § 
309(j)(3)(E)(i); 3.5 GHz R&O, 30 FCC Rcd at 4009, para. 153; Auction of Priority Access Licenses for the 3550-
3650 MHz Band; Comment Sought on Competitive Bidding Procedures for Auction 105; Bidding in Auction 105 
Scheduled to Begin June 25, 2020, AU Docket No. 19-244, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 9215 (2019).
188 See 47 U.S.C. § 309(j)(1).
189 See, e.g., 3.7 GHz R&O, 35 FCC Rcd at 2374-76, paras. 65-68.  While the Commission is not required to adopt 
bidding credits for a particular service, the part 1 rules provide that the Commission may do so by adopting small 
business or rural service provider bidding credits in the service-specific rules for a band.  See 47 CFR § 1.2110(f)(1).  
Any caps with respect to available bidding credits are adopted on an auction-by-auction basis.  Id. §§ 
1.2110(f)(2)(ii) (cap on designated entity bidding discount), 1.2110(f)(4)(ii) (cap on rural service provider discount).
190 The standardized schedule of bidding credits provided in section 1.2110(f)(2)(i) of the rules defines small 
businesses based on average gross revenues for the preceding three years.  In December 2018, Congress revised the 
standard set out in the Small Business Act for categorizing a business concern as a “small business concern,” by 
changing the annual average gross receipts benchmark from a three-year period to a five-year period.  Thus, as a 
general matter, a federal agency cannot propose to categorize a business concern as a “small business concern” for 
Small Business Act purposes unless the size of the concern is based on its annual average gross receipts “over a 
period of not less than 5 years.”  15 U.S.C. § 632(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), as amended by Small Business Runway Extension 
Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-324 (Dec. 17, 2018); see 13 CFR § 121.903(a)(1)(ii).  For consistency with the statutory 
requirements, we therefore propose to adopt the Small Business Act’s revised five-year average gross receipts 
benchmark for purposes of determining which entities qualify for small business bidding credits.
191  See 47 CFR § 1.2110(f)(2)(i)(B), (C).
192 See id.
511Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
85. AIA proposes that the Commission directly select NSS licensees from the submitted 
license applications based on criteria to be established by the FAA or by a multi-stakeholder group to 
ensure that applicants meet aviation performance levels and minimum performance standards established 
in RTCA DO-377A.193  We seek comment on AIA’s proposal or alternative approaches for selecting the 
NSS licensees and whether such approaches would be consistent with our statutory obligation under 
section 309(j) of the Act to use competitive bidding to resolve mutually exclusive applications, and with 
our general responsibility for licensing of spectrum uses under Title III of the Communications Act.194  
86. Regardless of the assignment mechanism, we seek comment on whether NSS licensees 
should be subject to a particular limit on the amount of NSS spectrum they can aggregate in the 5030-
5091 MHz band, such as a limit of 20 megahertz.  To the extent that NSS spectrum is assigned on 
geographic market basis, are limits on 5030-5091 MHz spectrum aggregation necessary to ensure 
competition for network-based CNPC services?
87.Technical requirements.  We seek comment on appropriate technical requirements and 
parameters for NSS licenses.  As an initial matter, the appropriate technical requirements may depend in 
part on the types of operations likely to be carried out in the band and the network architectures necessary 
to support such operations.  Accordingly, we seek comment on what operations commenters anticipate the 
NSS licensees will be used to support.  Will they include Advanced Air Mobility, package delivery 
services, or infrastructure inspection?  Are they likely to be predominantly operations above, or below, a 
certain altitude, or to involve predominantly large or predominantly small UA?  Will they involve 
autonomous operations, and if so, to what extent and for what purposes will such autonomous operations 
likely require network-based CNPC?  For those anticipated operations, we seek comment on what type of 
network architectures will likely be needed in the band to support such uses.  Will they necessarily be like 
the terrestrial cellular networks, or will there be other architectures, and if so, of what nature?  To the 
extent that parties have already developed or plan to deploy network infrastructure to support UAS NSS 
operations, we seek comment on what type of network architectures they have developed or plan to 
deploy for this purpose.  
88. We seek to adopt technical rules that will promote efficient use of spectrum and provide 
licensees as much flexibility as possible in terms of the services they wish to provide, while also 
providing adequate protection of licensees in the band or adjacent bands.  We seek comment on 
requirements that will achieve these goals in the context of spectrum intended to support network-based 
UAS CNPC with the level of reliability needed for safety-critical aviation purposes.  In particular, we 
seek comment on whether the RTCA DO-362A standard or equivalent technical parameters, which we 
propose above for NNA operations, should also apply to NSS licenses.  Would adopting similar 
requirements for NSS help to ensure compatibility between NNA and NSS operations?  We ask that 
commenters discuss the adequacy of the RTCA DO-362A specified equipment and operational 
performance requirements for NSS operations, including both transmitter power and receiver input power, 
and required minimum coupling loss (separation distance) between ground and airborne CNPC radios and 
emissions from other licensed radio services.  We also seek comment on whether to require NSS licensees 
to comply with RTCA DO-377A, which addresses the minimum performance, safety, and security 
standards for a CNPC link system overall, whether that system relies on a network or a direct link.195  As 
noted above, AIA recommends that we require UAS equipment to comply with RTCA DO-362A, but 
leave the requirements in RTCA DO-377A to be considered by the FAA or an appropriate group of 
193 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 6; AIA Feb. 1, 2022 Ex Parte, Attach. at 6.
194 See 47 U.S.C. § 309(j)(1).  
195 See supra para. 69; see also, e.g., Wisk Refresh PN Comments at 2 n.5 (“DO-377A provides a basis for the 
safety, performance, and security standards that a CNPC network should meet . . . .”). 
512Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
stakeholders.196  We seek comment on whether to take this approach for NSS licensees.  To the extent that 
NSS licensees are permitted to support communications other than CNPC, we seek comment on whether 
those services should be subject to the same technical requirements as apply to CNPC.  
89. Because the RTCA DO-362A standard is focused on point-to-point or point-to-multipoint 
(i.e., non-networked) link performance rather than network services, and RTCA DO-377A on establishing 
the minimum performance, security, and safety standards of a system rather than mitigating interference 
impacts on other systems, we seek comment on whether application of either of these standards 
sufficiently address the impact of wide area network operations, including cellular networks, on other 
services in-band or in adjacent bands.  We further seek comment on whether applying these standards, or 
specific parameters drawn from these standards, to network-based services in the band may unnecessarily 
restrict the range of services or operations in the band.  We seek comment on whether there are any 
additional or alternative technical requirements that we should consider for NSS licenses and on the 
extent to which communications under these technical requirements would have sufficient reliability for 
safety-critical aviation purposes.  To the extent that parties argue for alternative technical requirements, 
we ask that they be specific as to what requirements they propose be adopted in the rules.
90. We note that work is ongoing to develop technical standards for reliable UAS 
communications over mobile networks.  For example, RTCA SC-228 is currently working on a joint 
standard with EUROCAE Working Group 105 “for use of Cellular commercial networks for [command-
and-control] Links used for type certificated UAS.”197  CTIA states that the 3rd Generation Partnership 
Project (3GPP) “is addressing how commercial wireless [Long Term Evolution (LTE)] technologies can 
satisfy key performance indicators . . . for UAS, and support various UAS use cases.”198  We seek 
comment on these efforts, on the scope, status, and anticipated completion date of any other current or 
planned studies or standards development work regarding the reliability of UAS communications over 
LTE or other mobile network technologies, and on whether these studies or standards will address or 
apply to UAS network-based communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  If not, we seek comment on 
whether the development of these studies or standards may nevertheless be helpful in determining the 
appropriate requirements for networks in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  We further seek comment on the 
extent to which any of these studies or standards are being or will be coordinated with the aviation 
community or the FAA to ensure that they provide sufficient reliability for all UAS use cases, including 
aviation flights where communications is safety-critical.  We also seek comment on the extent to which 
mobile networks using LTE or other mobile network technologies can be implemented in the 5030-5091 
MHz band consistent with the RTCA DO-362A standard.
196 See AIA Refresh PN Comments at 8, 13-14; see also RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 7 (recommending that the 
Commission impose no altitude limits on usage in the 5030-5091 MHz band, but indicating that “[t]he FAA may 
wish to impose limitations based on the types of UA flight operations” (citing DO-362A, Appx. H and DO-377A, 
Appx. A)); WInnForum Refresh PN Comments at 3 (advocating that the Commission establish rules with “the 
minimum necessary technical restrictions to provide adequate protection against harmful interference”).  Above, we 
address in greater detail the potential reliance on a multi-stakeholder group to further develop recommendations or 
standards for UAS or DFMS operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band.

worldwide”).

513Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
91. As an alternative to requiring NSS compliance with the RTCA DO-362A standard 
generally, are there certain specific requirements of RTCA DO-362A that we should minimally impose, 
to ensure compatibility with NNA operations or for other purposes?  For example, as we noted earlier, 
RTCA asserts that all equipment in the band must comply with the 50 ms Time Division Duplex (TDD) 
requirements specified under section 2.2.1.3 of the RTCA DO-362A standard to ensure that UAS 
operations in the band are compatible with each other.199  We seek comment on whether, even if we do 
not require general compliance with RTCA DO-362A, we should mandate compliance with the TDD 
requirements under section 2.2.1.3.  Further, we seek comment on whether we should, at a minimum, 
require NSS equipment to comply with the power limits and out-of-band emission limits established in 
the standard to ensure that such equipment is compatible with AeroMACS.200  
92. We seek comment on any other technical issues that need to be addressed to enable the 
deployment of NSS networks.  For example, in order to prevent harmful interference between geographic 
area licensees, such licensees are typically subject to market boundary power strength limitations.201  
Because the networks deployed by geographic area licensees are terrestrial in nature, these limitations 
were developed using certain technical assumptions—i.e., that natural and manmade terrestrial obstacles 
attenuate signals, reducing the potential of harmful interference between users in adjacent license service 
areas.202  Obstacles such as hills, trees, buildings, and other natural and manmade structures attenuate 
emissions, lessening the interference impact between licensees.  UAS operations typically fly above many 
of these obstacles and, depending on the UA altitude and its distance to the service area boundary border, 
a UA may be in direct line-of-sight with adjacent license areas and users, greatly increasing the potential 
for harmful interference.  As we anticipate adopting geographic area-based licenses for NSS spectrum, we 
request comment on an appropriate field strength limit to protect NSS licensees given this increased 
potential for harmful interference.  We seek comment on other necessary technical specifications, such as 
out-of-band emission limits, and ask that any proposals include technical justifications and analysis, such 
as UA altitude assumptions, power levels, antenna assumptions, the increasing interference effects 
resulting from the increasing number of transmitting UA (aggregate effects), and the victim receiver 
characteristics such as receiver sensitivity, and adjacent and non-adjacent channel rejection.  
93.Application of requirements from aviation service and wireless radio service rules.  As 
with NNA service rules above, we seek comment on whether and to what extent the NSS service rules 
should incorporate or be subject to the rules generally applicable to aviation services under subparts B 
through F of part 87 of the Commission’s rules, either in their current form or with modifications.203  We 
also seek comment on whether the NSS service should be subject to rules under part 1, subpart F 
governing Wireless Radio Service applications and proceedings.204  In particular, we seek comment on 
199 See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 6; see also AIA Refresh PN Comments at 11 (supporting a requirement that 
transmitters comply with the 50 ms TDD requirements of RTCA DO-362A § 2.2.1.3).
200 See, e.g., L3H Refresh PN Comments at 10 (“The Output Power restrictions identified RTCA DO-362A § 
2.2.1.6.1.1 & 2.2.1.6.1.2 in addition to the C Band Airborne Radio Transmitter PSD Limits specified in RTCA DO-
362A § 2.2.1.6.2 should protect AeroMACS from potentially harmful interference from UAS.”); see also RTCA 
DO-377A at § 3.3.1.2 (“Based on the analysis in DO-362A . . . , the use of C-Band CNPC LOS radios of the C2 
Link for surface operations will be compatible with AeroMACS in airports where AeroMACS is available.”).
201 See 47 CFR § 27.55.  
202 For example, geographic area licensees’ service area power limits in sections 22.913(b) and 27.55(d) and (e) of 
the Commission’s rules are measured at a height 1.6 meters above ground level to estimate the height of a mobile 
(UE) taking into account terrain obstacles.  See 47 CFR §§ 22.913(b), 27.55(d), (e).

Services” is currently defined as “[a]ll radio services authorized in parts 13, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 30, 74, 80, 87, 90, 95, 
96, 97 and 101 of this chapter, whether commercial or private in nature.”  47 CFR § 1.907.

whether to allow partitioning and disaggregation of NSS licenses in secondary market transactions as well 
as spectrum leasing, including whether we should consider any competitive impacts associated with such 
transactions.205  Allowing these secondary market transactions would be consistent with the licensing 
paradigm governing most geographic area licenses and are potentially an effective way to improve 
spectral efficiency and facilitate targeted network deployments, particularly if the Commission adopts a 
long license term or large license area.  We seek comment on whether these factors support application of 
the full range of secondary market options to 5030-5091 MHz NSS licensees, or if secondary market rules 
should either be more restrictive or completely inapplicable due to special considerations of the 5030-
5091 MHz band.  
94. We anticipate that NSS licenses will be used to provide mobile network services to UAS 
operators on a commercial basis.  Accordingly, we also seek comment on whether and to what extent we 
should incorporate regulations that regulate commercial mobile networks in other bands, such as the 
requirements generally applicable to part 27 flexible-use licensees.  For example, should we incorporate 
or apply the requirements of sections 27.52 (RF safety), 27.56 (antenna structure height for the protection 
of air safety), or 27.64 (protection from interference)?206  
95.Other requirements.  We seek comment on any other service rules we should adopt for 
NSS licensees.  For example, to ensure that UA flights are supported in the event they need to cross 
license area boundaries, should we adopt a roaming requirement?  If anything more than market forces is 
necessary to address this issue, should the current roaming requirements under section 20.12(e) of the 
Commission’s rules, requiring commercial mobile data service providers to offer roaming arrangements 
to other such providers on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, be extended to NSS licensees 
for this purpose?207  If these requirements are sufficient, how and where should we integrate them in the 
context of NSS service rules?  If they are insufficient, what additional rules are needed to ensure that 
UAS operate continually and safely across licensing areas?  We also seek comment on whether to adopt 
an interoperability requirement, for example, requiring NSS equipment to be capable of operating over 
any part of the 5030-5091 MHz band dedicated to NSS operations, or requiring support for the entire 
band.  We further seek comment on whether to impose requirements to enable seamless switching 
between NNA and NSS services to support flights that may need to rely on both modes of spectrum 
access.  Should we require NSS licensees to provide any other information, including the manufacturer, 
model, or other details regarding the UAs that will be flown?  We seek comment on any requirements or 
other measures that would promote intensive use of the band.  For example, we seek comment on how we 
might facilitate use of NSS for both low and high altitude uses, and whether we should require NSS 
licensees to support both low and high altitude uses or should take other steps to ensure that both low and 
high uses are supported.  
96.Satellite-based networks.  As discussed above, the 5030-5091 MHz band is allocated 
internationally and domestically for AMS(R)S, which would support the provision of CNPC services over 
satellite.  AIA’s petition for rulemaking, however, did not request or propose that any provision be made 
for satellite services in the band, and no party in the current record has proposed such an option.208  It also 
appears that RTCA’s work on CNPC MOPS in the 5030-5091 MHz band has, up to now, largely focused 
205 See 47 CFR pt. 1, subpt. X (spectrum leasing), § 1.950 (partitioning and disaggregation).

207 See 47 CFR § 20.12(e).

“[t]errestrial station owners”); see also id. at 5 (distinguishing between beyond-line-of-sight operations in the past, 
which were based on satellite-support, and “the future of terrestrial CNPC links” that would involve “multiple, 
remote [Ground Radio Stations] on a network providing long-range, continuous C2 link coverage and remote 
operation, without reliance on or the disadvantages of satellite communications links.”); RTCA Refresh PN

links and have significant capacity).

on terrestrial rather than satellite services in the band.209  We nevertheless seek comment on whether to 
authorize NSS licensees, at their discretion, to provide network-supported service for UAS CNPC through 
either a satellite or terrestrial network, or alternatively, whether the Commission should provide that 
certain NSS licenses are dedicated exclusively to satellite-based service.210  We seek comment on whether 
and to what extent there is interest in the United States in providing a satellite service for CNPC in the 
5030-5091 MHz band, on the costs and benefits of permitting NSS licensees to deploy satellite services 
for network-supported CNPC, and on the advantages and disadvantages of a satellite option over 
terrestrial networks in this context.  For example, would satellite be a feasible and desirable means of 
deploying a CNPC-focused network with the ubiquitous coverage needed to support long-range 
operations, particularly those operations that may occur in remote areas and over oceanic regions or other 
large bodies of water?  
97. Assuming we permit NSS licensees to deploy satellite-based service, we seek comment 
on how to permit and integrate the provision of such services and on the appropriate service rules.  We 
seek comment on the application of the Commission’s part 25 rules, which govern satellite 
communications, to such services, and the extent to which the rules applicable to terrestrial NSS networks 
should also apply to satellite-based NSS networks.  We further seek comment on how the DFMS and 
other proposals discussed above would work for satellite communications.  For example, how would a 
DFMS implement opportunistic access to spectrum in which satellite operations might be deployed?  We 
also seek comment on how to ensure that any such satellite services are compatible with both terrestrial 
NSS and NNA operations in the band and other in-band and adjacent-band services, and on the 
circumstances, requirements, coordination processes, and/or restrictions necessary to ensure compatibility 
and to provide the reliability intended for CNPC in this band.  For example, should we permit an NSS 
licensee to deploy a satellite service only if the NSS license is nationwide or the licensee in question has 
aggregated all geographic area licenses in a particular block throughout the nation?  Are guard bands 
necessary between blocks with satellite deployments and blocks used for terrestrial networks or 
operations?  Footnote 5.443D of the Table of Frequency Allocations provides that services under the 
satellite allocation in the 5030-5091 MHz band are subject to coordination under ITU Radio Regulations 
(R.R.) No. 9.11A, and that the use of this frequency band by the AMS(R)S is limited to internationally 
standardized aeronautical systems.211  We seek comment on what rules, if any, we should adopt to 
implement the requirements under footnote 5.443D.
98.High-Altitude Platform Stations.  We seek comment on whether to permit NSS licensees 
to deploy High-altitude Platform Stations (HAPS).  The Commission’s rules define a “High Altitude 
Platform Station” as “[a] station located on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, 
nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth.”212  Potentially, these stations could be used by NSS licensees 
as a long-range relay of CNPC between two or more stations, and RTCA DO-362A includes extensive 
209 While the RTCA DO-362A MOPS focuses on “a ‘terrestrial’ based (i.e., not satellite-based) CNPC Link System” 
in the 5030-5091 MHz band, see RTCA DO-362A, § 1.1, it also includes discussion of a satellite system design 
compatible with the terrestrial system in an Appendix.  See RTCA DO-362A, Appx. G (C Band Satellite Link 
Compatibility).  In addition, the Terms of Reference for SC-228 (Rev 15) dated June 23, 2022, indicates that a 
planned update of RTCA DO-362A, to be designated DO-362B, will “[i]ncorporate changes required to harmonize 
SATCOM compatibility with EUROCAE Standard.”  See SC-228 June 2022 Terms of Reference at 5.   
210 See also supra section B.1 (Band Plan) (seeking comment on preserving a portion of the band for satellite 
CNPC). 
211 See 47 CFR § 2.106, footnote 5.443D.  ITU R.R. No. 9.11A provides that “for a station for which the 
requirements to coordinate is included in a footnote to the Table of Frequency Allocations referring to this 
provision, the provisions of Nos. 9.12 to 9.16 are applicable.”  ITU R.R. No. 9.11A.  ITU R.R. No. 9.6 in turn 
provides that “[b]efore an administration notifies to the Bureau or brings into use a frequency assignment in any of 
the cases listed below [including the cases covered by 9.11A], it shall effect coordination, as required, with other 
administrations identified under No. 9.27.”  ITU R.R. No. 9.6.

analysis of such an option, which it refers to as a “High-altitude Relay System.”213  We seek comment on 
whether and to what extent there is current interest in deploying HAPS as all or part of a network solution 
for CNPC, on the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the use of HAPS to provide all or part 
of a network service in the 5030-5091 MHz band, and on the costs and benefits of permitting HAPS for 
this purpose.214  To the extent it is feasible and economic, are there limitations on the circumstances or 
uses to which it can be applied?  For example, would it be available only to provide relay between two or 
more UA, or could it also provide relay between UA and stations on the ground?  We also seek comment 
on what technical or other requirements or restrictions are needed either to ensure that NSS use of HAPS 
to provide network service would be compatible with other operations and services or for other reasons.  
For example, we seek comment on whether, consistent with the definition of HAPS in the Commission’s 
rules, we should specify an altitude floor and/or ceiling on the use of such stations.215  Given the potential 
footprint of a HAPS-based service, should we permit an NSS licensee to deploy HAPS only if the NSS 
licensee holds a nationwide market or holds all geographic area licenses on a particular block nationwide?  
We further seek comment on whether permitting such systems warrants any revisions to the proposals or 
options for the NSS rules.  In addition, because the HAPS acting as network relays for UA 
communications would also themselves be UA, we seek comment on whether an NSS licensee’s 
operation of such stations may require CNPC (during ascent, descent, or otherwise), whether and to what 
extent such stations should be permitted to use NNA assignments for CNPC, and if so, what changes to 
our NNA proposals or other rules are needed.216  We note that No. 4.23 of the ITU Radio Regulations 
provides that “[t]ransmissions to or from high altitude platform stations shall be limited to bands 
specifically identified in Article 5 (WRC-12).”217  At present, Article 5 does not specifically identify the 
5030-5091 MHz band for this purpose.218  We seek comment on whether, if we restricted such stations to 
deployments below the 20 km floor for HAPS as defined in the ITU Radio Regulations, permitting HAPS 
in the band could nonetheless be consistent with No. 4.23 or if, to permit such use, we would need to seek 
213 See, e.g., RTCA DO-362A, Appx. U (C Band High Altitude Relay System).  In its comment, RTCA refers to this 
option as a “High-Altitude Platform/Relay System.”  RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 5.
214 The record does not reflect any current interest in using HAPS for the provision of network-based CNPC in the 
band.  In comments submitted in 2018 in response to the AIA Petition, the Elefante Group did indicate that it 
planned to deploy what it described as “persistent, unmanned stratospheric airborne platforms (‘STRAPS’) . . . to 
provide stratospheric-based communications service,” and that it was interested in using direct links in the 5030-
5091 MHz band for command-and-control “[d]uring ascent and descent” of the stations.  Elefante Group AIA 
Petition Comments at 1-2.  Once in place, however, the stations were intended to provide “5G solutions in urban and 
rural markets” rather than CNPC services in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  Id.  In a subsequent filing in another 
proceeding, the Elefante Group further indicated, in regard to its plans to deploy STRAPS, that due to “unforeseen 
developments,” it was “unable to state with certainty its ability at this time to” deploy these platforms.  See Elefante 
Group Comments, WT Docket No. 20-133, at 2 (filed Aug. 5, 2020).
215 47 CFR § 2.1(c).
216 RTCA asserts that the necessary duration of an assignment to support such HAPS relays may be significantly 
longer than assignments for other types of UA flights.  See RTCA Refresh PN Comments at 5 (asserting that 
because the HAPS relay scenario will involve a UA that “loiters for months at altitude > 60Kft., the ‘end of flight’ 
would be much longer after the beginning of the flight than for non-[HAPS] flights” and that “[c]ontinuous usage of 
the spectrum would be needed throughout the flight to support internal control messages being sent to/from the 
[HAPS] UA”).
217 ITU R.R. No. 4.23.
218 Article V of the ITU Radio Regulations reflects the frequency allocation decisions made by the World Radio 
Councils (WRC) to date.  See ITU R.R., Article V; see also 47 CFR § 2.106.  At three WRCs collectively (WRC-97, 
WRC-200, and WRC-12), spectrum for HAPS was designated in the 47/48 GHz, 2 GHz, 27/31 GHz and 6 GHz 
bands, and after study for WRC-19, additional spectrum was identified: 31-31.3 GHz and 38-39.5 GHz globally, and 
in Region 2 (including US), 21.4-22 GHz and 24.25-27.5 GHz.  See Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Seeks to 
Supplement the Record on 70/80/90 GHz Bands Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WT Docket No. 20-133, Public 
Notice, DA 21-1263, n.15 (WTB Oct. 8, 2021).
517Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
a revision to the bands in which HAPS is permitted under ITU R.R., Article V.  We seek comment on 
whether there is any other legal constraint or consideration to address in permitting such use. 
8. Equipment Authorization
99. To ensure that equipment in the new band has the level of reliability and safety required 
of aviation equipment, we propose to impose equipment authorization requirements similar to those under 
sections 87.145 and 87.147 of the Commission’s rules to all equipment intended for use in the 5030-5091 
MHz band.  Section 87.145 requires that each transmitter must be certificated for use in the relevant 
service, and section 87.147 establishes a specific equipment authorization process for part 87 equipment, 
which, for the frequencies in the 5030-5091 MHz band among others, requires coordination with the 
FAA.219  We note that 5030-5091 MHz UAS radio equipment must independently satisfy any applicable 
FAA requirements,220 and we anticipate that this coordination process will ensure that the 5030-5091 
MHz equipment authorizations by the Commission and the FAA are consistent and that all equipment 
approved for use in the band will meet both agencies’ requirements.  We seek comment on our proposals.  
9. Protection of Other Services
a. Microwave Landing Systems
100. The Microwave Landing System (MLS) is a radio guidance system that was intended to 
be installed at airports to aid aircraft in landing when, e.g., the airports are visually obscured by bad 
weather, and that provided certain technical improvements over the original Instrument Landing 
System.221  Footnote 5.444 of the Table of Frequency Allocations provides that in the band 5030-5150 
MHz, the requirements of MLS have priority over other uses of this frequency band.222  
101. These systems were rendered obsolete by more recent instrument-landing solutions, 
including GPS-based solutions like the Wide Area Augmentation System, and a search of ULS reveals no 
active MLS in use by non-federal licensees.223  Further, according to NTIA’s most recent summary of 
federal use of the 5030-5250 MHz band, “[t]he FAA does not anticipate utilizing MLS installations at 
airports.”224  NTIA also notes, however, that “[t]he Air Force has a number of assignments in the 5030-
5091 MHz band for a transportable version of the MLS, an all-weather precision landing system for 
tactical purposes and has installed these systems at several Air Force bases.”225  It states that “the Air 
Force will continue to use MLS into the foreseeable future in order to provide landing guidance to 
military aircraft.”226
102. We seek comment on what measures we should adopt to protect federal MLS services 
from harmful interference by UAS communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  Should we establish 
exclusion zones around the Air Force bases with MLS deployments, with a process to add or eliminate 
219 See 47 CFR §§ 87.145(a), 87.147(d).

222 See 47 CFR § 2.106, footnote 5.444; see also 47 CFR § 87.173(b) (authorizing MLS over the frequencies 5030-
5150 MHz).  The rules also permit deployment of “radionavigation land test” stations at 5031 MHz but only for the 
testing of MLS airborne receiving equipment.  See 47 CFR § 87.475(c)(2).

exclusion zones to the extent federal MLS stations are deployed or deactivated?  AIA proposes that the 
Commission codify the locations at which MLS operations are conducted and establish a coordination 
mechanism to enable UAS CNPC operations near those MLS stations.227  We seek comment on this 
option, the specifics of any such coordination mechanism, and how this or any option would address the 
deployment of new federal MLS stations, particularly in the case of NSS licensees that may have already 
deployed networks in the area of the new deployment.   
103. Because we find no current licensed non-federal MLS systems in operation, and given 
that the FAA does not anticipate the future use of these systems at airports, we seek comment on whether 
any measures are necessary to protect non-federal MLS.  We also seek comment on whether to provide 
that no future non-federal MLS licenses (including MLS radionavigation land test licenses at 5031 MHz) 
will be granted in the 5030-5091 MHz band by amending sections 87.173(b) and 87.475 of our part 87 
rules to remove the 5030-5091 MHz band as a band that can be used for non-federal MLS.228  We seek 
comment on the costs and benefits of this option.  Would eliminating the potential for future non-federal 
MLS in the 5030-5091 MHz band help to ensure a stable spectral environment that may facilitate the use 
of the band for UAS CNPC?  Would it facilitate the use of the band for other communications, to the 
extent such communications may be permitted?  Given the development and widespread adoption of 
alternative solutions for instrument-based landing and the apparent abandonment of MLS, is there any 
need to preserve the option in our rules for licensing of non-federal MLS in this band?  
b. Out-of-band Services
104.Radioastronomy.  Footnote US211 of the Table of Frequency Allocations currently 
provides that in a number of frequency bands that includes the 5000-5250 MHz band, “applicants for 
airborne or space station assignments are urged to take all practicable steps to protect radio astronomy 
observations in the adjacent bands from harmful interference[.]”229  To address the potential impact on 
radio astronomy observations from UAS transmissions in the 5030-5091 MHz band, NTIA requests that 
Footnote US211 continue to apply to any services authorized in the 5030-5091 MHz band.230  NTIA also 
recommends that the Commission require coordination of UAS operations within the National Radio 
Quiet Zone (NRQZ).231  NTIA further recommends that “additional criteria” be developed to minimize 
UAS impact to particular radio astronomy sites, particularly from low-altitude operations, but does not 
elaborate or propose particular criteria.232  As a further measure, NTIA recommends that the requirements 
227 See AIA Petition at 18; see also AURA AIA Petition Comments at 6; Boeing AIA Petition Comments at 11; 
Lockheed Martin AIA Petition Comments at 4-5.
228 We note that removing the frequencies for non-federal MLS operations from our service rules would not affect 
federal authority to utilize the band for MLS, or the need to protect such services.
229 See 47 CFR § 2.106, footnote US211.  For certain of these bands, the obligation is limited by Footnote US74, 
which provides that in the specified bands, the radio astronomy service shall be protected from unwanted emissions 
only to the extent that such radiation exceeds the level which would be present if the offending station were 
operating in compliance with the technical standards or criteria applicable to the service in which it operates.  See 47 
CFR § 2.106, footnote US74.  The 5030-5091 MHz band, however, is not one of the bands to which Footnote US74 
applies.  Id.
230 See NTIA Refresh PN Reply at 1.
231 See NTIA Refresh PN Comments at 2.  The National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) is a fixed 13,000 square mile 
rectangular area that covers portions of Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland and that provides interference 
protection to radio astronomy operations of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green Bank, West 
Virginia, and the Naval Radio Research Observatory at Sugar Grove, West Virginia.  See, e.g., 47 CFR §§ 1.924(a), 
97.3(a)(33); Service Rules for Advanced Wireless Services in the 1.7 GHz and 2.1 GHz Bands, WT Docket 02-353,

for licensees in the band include passing a test or similar effort to promote awareness of radio astronomy 
sites.233 
105. We seek comment on whether additional measures are necessary to protect radio 
astronomy and on NTIA’s recommendations in this regard.  We propose, consistent with NTIA’s 
recommendations, to continue to apply the requirements of Footnote US211 in the 5030-5091 MHz band, 
to prohibit UAS operations within the NRQZ without prior coordination with the NRQZ administrator 
and, in the case of NNA operations relying on DFMS assignments, to require the submission of a 
concurrence from the NRQZ administrator with any request to a DFMS for frequency assignment within 
the NRQZ.  We seek comment on these proposals.  We note that section 1.924(a) of the Commission’s 
rules establishes required procedures for licensees and applicants that seek to construct or operate new or 
modified fixed stations to coordinate their deployments in the NRQZ.234  Should we apply these 
licensee/applicant procedures for the NRQZ to all UAS operations relying on the 5030-5091 MHz band in 
the NRQZ?  To the extent we require NRQZ administrator concurrence for licensed-by-rule operations, 
we seek comment on the appropriate procedures to apply.  To the extent measures beyond coordination 
and concurrence requirements for UAS operations are warranted, we seek comment on what other 
measures are practicable.  
106.AeroMACS.  AeroMACS is a broadband aeronautical mobile (route) service system that 
will enable communications for surface operations at airports between aircraft and other vehicles and 
between other critical fixed assets.235  The Commission has allocated both the 5000-5030 MHz and 5091-
5150 MHz bands for such use but has not yet established service rules in either band.236  
107. We seek comment on whether any special measures are necessary to ensure compatibility 
between UAS operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and AeroMACS.  AIA indicates that RTCA is 
currently working on a revision to the AeroMACS technical standard, RTCA DO-346, that will ensure 
that future AeroMACS deployments will be compatible with CNPC links that are in compliance with 
RTCA DO-362A, and that no other special limitations on 5030-5091 MHz operations beyond compliance 
with RTCA DO-362A are necessary.237  More recently, RTCA’s Program Management Committee 
(PMC) held its June 2022 meeting approving RTCA DO-346A with these revisions.238  We seek comment 
233 See id.

on whether the revised AeroMACS standard and compliance with the power and out-of-band emission 
limits of RTCA DO-362A are adequate measures to protect AeroMACS operations from harmful 
interference from 5030-5091 MHz UAS operations, and whether the revisions to the AeroMACS standard 
require specific service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band.  Should we adopt exclusion zones around 
airports with AeroMACS deployments, or prohibit use of a certain amount of spectrum at the edge of the 
5030-5091 MHz band in the vicinity of such airports?  
108.Radionavigation-satellite service.  The 5010-5030 MHz band also includes an allocation 
for the radionavigation-satellite service (RNSS) (space-to-Earth) for potential future use.239  Footnote 
5.443C of the Table of Frequency Allocations addresses requirements in the 5030-5091 MHz band for the 
protection of RNSS downlinks.240  Specifically, it provides that “[u]nwanted emissions from the 
aeronautical mobile (R) service in the frequency band 5030-5091 MHz shall be limited to protect RNSS 
system downlinks in the adjacent 5010-5030 MHz band” and that “[u]ntil such time that an appropriate 
value is established in a relevant ITU-R Recommendation, the e.i.r.p. density limit of -75 dBW/MHz in 
the frequency band 5010-5030 MHz for any AM(R)S station unwanted emission should be used.”241  As 
CNPC services would be part of the AM(R)S allocation, this requirement applies to such services in the 
5030-5091 MHz band.  We propose to require 5030-5091 MHz operations to comply with the specific 
EIRP spectral density limit specified in Footnote 5.443C and seek comment on that proposal.  Footnote 
5.443C further limits AM(R)S use of the 5030-5091 MHz band to “internationally standardized 
aeronautical systems.”242  We seek comment on codifying this requirement as a service rule and on 
whether any other measure is necessary to implement the restriction.  We further seek comment on 
whether any other special measures applicable to the 5030-5091 MHz band, such as a guard band at the 
bottom edge of the 5030-5091 MHz band, should be adopted to protect RNSS system downlinks.243 
109.Flight testing.  The 5091-5150 MHz band is also allocated for aeronautical mobile 
telemetry communications from aircraft stations, subject to the technical parameters in ITU Resolution 
418 (WRC-12) intended to ensure compatibility with other services.244  According to NTIA, federal 
agencies currently use this allocation in the 5091-5150 MHz band to support flight testing.245  We seek 
comment on whether measures beyond generally applicable out-of-band emissions limits are necessary to 
ensure that 5030-5091 MHz operations are compatible with such services. 
c. Canadian and Mexican Coordination
110. International agreements with Mexico and Canada do not address the use of the 5030-
5091 MHz band for UAS communications.246  In the event of any adjustments made to the agreements 
with Mexico or Canada regarding use of the 5030-5091 MHz band, we note that our proposed rules, and

any rules that may ultimately become effective pursuant to this proceeding, may need to be modified to 
comply with those agreements.  We seek comment on whether we should adopt an interim measure to 
address UAS communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band that may cause harmful interference to 
operations in Mexico or Canada during the period prior to any adjustments made to the agreements 
between the United States, Mexico, and/or Canada regarding use of the band.  If so, what should this 
interim measure provide? 
III. AIRBORNE USE OF FLEXIBLE-USE SPECTRUM
111. Beyond the development of the 5030-5091 MHz band for UAS operations, the use of 
flexible-use spectrum247 and existing networks as platforms for UAS offers promise because these 
existing networks provide significant coverage with low latency, high throughput, and dedicated and 
secure communications.  The use of such existing infrastructure may provide the added benefit of a near-
term, low-cost option in comparison to building a dedicated network for UAS operations.
112. There is considerable interest in using existing terrestrial mobile networks for UAS 
communications, including command and control, telemetry, and payload communications.  Because 
these networks were not designed for UAS use, however, the integration of UAS into terrestrial mobile 
networks may not be a seamless transition.  The Commission’s terrestrial mobile service rules generally 
do not consider airborne use, and whether within a network or across adjacent networks, the potential for 
increased interference is probable when UAS are introduced. 
113. While the Commission remains committed to allowing flexibility in the use of existing 
spectrum and networks, we are uncertain about the potential interference impacts of UAS use.  Therefore, 
we seek comment on the adequacy of current rules to ensure co-existence of existing terrestrial wireless 
networks and UAS and on the regulatory solutions that may be necessary to facilitate and encourage such 
use.  Our action is consistent with WTB and OET’s recommendation in the Section 374 Report to conduct 
further review of the flexible-use bands for UAS.248
A. Background
114. Federal agencies, industry stakeholders, and standards bodies have undertaken significant 
work to facilitate use of UAS, including development of flexible-use spectrum as a platform.  As interest 
in and demand for UAS services grows, this initial work will form the foundation for the additional 
research and testing that is necessary to evaluate the need for further regulatory action by the 
Commission, where appropriate.
115.FAA Programs.  As noted, the FAA has engaged in a variety of initiatives to safely 
integrate UAS into the National Airspace System, some of which considered the use of various spectrum 
bands as platforms for UAS.  Among these initiatives, in 2017, the FAA established the UAS Integration 
Pilot Program (IPP) to permit state, local, and Tribal governments to partner with private sector entities, 
such as UAS operators or manufacturers, to accelerate safe UAS integration.249  IPP participants evaluated 
several operational concepts, including night-time operations, flights over people and beyond-visual-line-
of-sight operations, package delivery, detect-and-avoid technologies, and link reliability.250  The IPP 
program concluded in October 2020 after which the FAA launched a new program called BEYOND, 
247 The term “flexible-use spectrum” or “flexible-use bands,” refers to services or spectrum bands for which the 
Commission’s rules do not prescribe specific uses or applications.

which is intended to continue the work of UAS integration.251  The FAA also chartered the Unmanned 
Aircraft Systems Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight Operations Aviation Rulemaking Committee (BVLOS 
ARC) in June 2021 to review insights gained from these and other activities and to provide 
recommendations regarding performance-based regulatory requirements that will enable the integration of 
beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations in the National Airspace System.252  In March 2022, the BVLOS 
ARC issued a Final Report, making over 70 recommendations regarding regulatory changes to facilitate 
such operations.253  The BVLOS ARC Final Report noted that “[r]eliable and continuous access to 
spectrum is essential to the continued growth of the UAS industry” and that it is critical for all available 
communications technology to be enabled.254
116.Stakeholder Interest in UAS on Flexible-Use Spectrum.  Manufacturers, service 
providers, and public and private UAS operators support using a wide range of bands for UAS operations 
in addition to spectrum bands dedicated to aeronautical use,255 and research is underway to study the 
potential of flexible-use spectrum for UAS uses.  For example, in accordance with its Part 5 Program 
Experimental Radio License rules, the Commission in August 2021 approved the North Carolina State 
University Innovation Zone256 for use by the Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced 
Wireless (AERPAW).257  The AERPAW testbed is the first research platform to study the use of 5G 
wireless technology as a platform for UAS.258  Several mobile service providers and other stakeholders 
currently are developing network-based UAS applications that would operate over commercial networks 
251 See FAA, BEYOND, https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/beyond/ (last visited Sept. 6, 2022).  As 
part of the BEYOND program, the FAA is continuing its partnerships with eight of the nine IPP participants, which 
continue to test and refine varying UAS operational concepts.  Id.

using flexible-use spectrum259 and are testing UAS operations on their networks for interference and other 
performance issues.260  Verizon, for example, has stated that it is “actively testing how the use of its 
commercial mobile network to support drone deployments affects its own networks, neighboring 
licensees in adjacent geographies, and neighboring licensees in adjacent bands to ensure the avoidance of 
harmful interference.”261  To this end, Verizon—through its subsidiary Skyward—and the FAA have 
entered into a three-year Memorandum of Agreement to research the use of Verizon’s network for 
command-and-control (C2) purposes and beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations.262
117.UAS Standards.  Standards bodies, such as 3GPP,263 are conducting ongoing studies to 
determine the extent of interference that may be caused by UAS operations within a terrestrial network, 
and to develop, as necessary, techniques to manage and mitigate the increased risk of harmful interference 
posed by UAS.264  As noted, 3GPP is developing updates to its standards to enable LTE wireless networks 
in flexible-use bands to support UAS applications.265  To this end, as part of Release 15 of the technical 
standard for Long Term Evolution (LTE), 3GPP concluded a study item on the use of LTE for UAS, in 
which it proposed various interference mitigation strategies.266  
118. The Commission’s Technological Advisory Council’s (TAC)267 Communication 
Strategies for Unmanned Aircraft working group was tasked with studying spectrum issues for UAS.268

264 In addition, in 2017, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) established the Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems Standardization Collaborative (UASSC) as a coordinating body to accelerate the development of the 
standards and conformity assessment programs needed to facilitate the safe integration of UAS into the U.S. national 
airspace.  Most recently, in June 2022, ANSI released an update to its Gaps Progress Report, which tracks efforts by 
standards developing organizations and others to address identified gaps where additional standardization work is 
needed.  See ANSI, Gaps Progress Report Available: ANSI UASSC Standardization Roadmap for Unmanned

267 The FCC’s Technological Advisory Council (TAC) provides technical advice to the FCC. The TAC is organized 
under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.  The current TAC, which is the FCC’s 5th 
Technological Advisory Council, was formed on October 21, 2010.  The TAC is comprised of a diverse array of 
leading experts that helps the FCC identify important areas of innovation and develop informed technology policies 
supporting America’s competitiveness and job creation in the global economy.

control, payload, identification, and collision avoidance.269  The working group issued a series of reports 
in 2019, which concluded that flexible-use mobile networks using 3GPP technologies can satisfy 
communications requirements for low-altitude UA, but noted that interference remains a concern and an 
area for further study.270  The ITU has also studied spectrum issues for UAS,271 and IEEE  has formed a 
technical committee related to aerial robotics and UAS.272 
119. As discussed above, the RTCA is working with the FAA to develop industry-endorsed 
standards to enable UAS.  In addition to developing MOPS for line-of-sight C2 transmissions for the 
5030-5091 MHz band, RTCA Special Committee 228 is currently conducting work regarding cellular 
network standards for UAS.273  
B. Applicable Spectrum Bands
120. The flexible-use spectrum landscape for potential UAS use is varied, consisting of bands 
that prohibit airborne use (in the Table of Frequency Allocations or by rule) and bands that are silent on 
airborne operation.  For example, Parts 22 and 96 explicitly prohibit the airborne use of Cellular 
Radiotelephone Service and CBRS spectrum.274  Likewise, the Table of Frequency Allocations precludes 
aeronautical mobile use for several other spectrum bands, including all or portions of the 1670-1675 
MHz, 1.4 GHz, 2.3 GHz (Wireless Communications Service), and 3.7 GHz bands.275  Other flexible-use 
bands, however, are silent regarding airborne operations.276  We seek comment on the spectrum bands that 
might be utilized for UAS, as well as the spectrum bands that would not be suitable for such operation 
(e.g., frequency bands with co-channel or adjacent channel services that require protection).
121. To inform our review, commenters should indicate the flexible-use bands in which they 
are currently operating or testing UAS.  In addition, we ask commenters to detail the flexible-use band(s) 
that they may be interested in using for UAS in the future, including bands with and without explicit rules 
or allocations prohibiting airborne use.  We also ask commenters to identify the type of communication

spectrum requirements to support their safe operation in non-segregated airspace.”  The report addresses the 
anticipated needs of both terrestrial and satellite spectrum requirements for UAS. 
272 According to the IEEE Aerial Robotics and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Committee’s website, “The technical 
committee will promote exchanges among researchers from academia, industry and government.  The purpose is to

as the type of technology or infrastructure needed to support such use.  
C. Sufficiency of Existing Rules
122. Certain entities maintain that our existing service and technical rules for the various 
flexible-use bands are sufficient to address the potential for harmful interference from UAS operations.277  
While our existing rules promote optimal flexibility for licensees, these rules are largely focused on 
terrestrial operations and were not designed with airborne operations in mind.  Although studies are 
underway to develop techniques to manage and mitigate the increased risk of harmful interference posed 
by UAS, at this time it is unclear whether these mitigation techniques and standards enhancements would 
be sufficient to protect existing wireless users and adjacent service area/band licensees from harmful 
interference caused by UAS use.  Further, the functionality exhibited by UAs may necessitate revising our 
rules to enable UAS operation on existing flexible-use networks.  In light of these interference concerns, 
we seek comment on whether modifications to our rules to protect existing terrestrial and other airborne 
operations are warranted.  
123.Interference mitigation.  Use of flexible-use spectrum by UAS can raise interference 
problems for co-channel and potentially adjacent-channel operations—particularly the high-density use 
that is expected to occur in the future.  The impact of UAs on mobile networks is different than 
conventional mobile devices due to the high altitude and high mobility of UAs.  The higher altitude of 
UAs means that they (1) can see and be seen by more base stations than a conventional mobile device; 
and (2) have more favorable propagation conditions than propagation experienced by terrestrial 
operations.  In addition, this high mobility, coupled with moving velocities up to 100 miles per hour 
under current FAA restrictions, can result in base station handoff issues and other network issues as 
described in detail below.278  These factors underlie two scenarios in which harmful interference can occur 
in the presence of UAS operating on flexible-use spectrum—downlink interference and uplink 
interference.  
124. In the downlink—communications from the base station to UAs—the UAs may operate 
at an altitude that is within line of sight of multiple base stations and, as a result, the UAs can receive 
downlink interference from those base stations.  Accordingly, UAs may experience more downlink 
interference than terrestrial user equipment because the enhanced propagation conditions and greater line-
of-sight cause downlink interference resulting from the multiple base stations visible to, and attempting to 
connect to, the UA.  The increased downlink interference leads to increased resource utilization levels in 
the network and eventually degrades the downlink performance of both airborne and terrestrial 
equipment.279
125. At the same time, in the uplink—communications from the UA to the base station—the 
same UA can also cause interference to these multiple line-of-sight base stations.  Uplink interference 
could increase as more UAs are introduced into the network.  This interference may also increase 
depending on the UA’s intended uses.  For example, UAs may generate more uplink traffic than is typical 
of conventional mobile devices due to the use of data rate-intensive applications, such as video streaming 
and data streaming; such applications increase spectrum demand and present an increased risk of uplink

interference.  The increased uplink interference from UAs affects the throughput performance of 
terrestrial user equipment:  as the number of UAs operating in a network increases, uplink resource 
utilization in the network also increases and at a greater rate than terrestrial-only operation.  Eventually, 
the uplink performance of both UA and terrestrial equipment in the network is degraded.
126. To support use of UAS in terrestrial mobile networks, in 2017, 3GPP published a 
technical report (TR36.777) investigating the ability for UAs to be served using terrestrial LTE 
networks.280  The report’s findings—which were based on the analysis of field trials performed by various 
companies analyzing LTE commercial network performance with the introduction of UAs—validated that 
downlink and uplink interference may result from UAS operation.281  The report proposed various 
network and UA enhancements to minimize LTE throughput degradation and interference to the network 
and to UAs and terrestrial devices.282    
127. TR36.777 confirmed the effect that UAS operations may have on downlink operations.  
The report observed that UAs uniformly distributed between 1.5 meters and 300 meters above ground 
level experienced downlink interference as a direct result of the UAs operating in the direct line-of-sight 
of more cells than terrestrial user equipment.283  This causes the UAs to receive downlink intercell 
interference from multiple cells.284  The resulting increase in resource utilization to provide for the 
introduction of UAs further decreases the spectral efficiency in the network and degrades downlink 
throughput performance of both UAs and terrestrial user equipment.285
128. The report similarly validated impacts on uplink interference.  To this end, it also was 
observed that since the UAs experience line-of-sight propagation conditions to more cells than terrestrial 
devices, the UAs would cause interference to more cells in the uplink than a typical terrestrial device.286  
The uplink interference caused by UAs degrades the throughput performance of terrestrial devices.287  The 
increase in resource utilization level further increases interference in the network, which in turn degrades 
the uplink throughput performance of both UAs and terrestrial user equipment.288
129. The report suggested several potential solutions to mitigate both uplink and downlink 
interference.  Many of the solutions can be implemented by network providers independently and do not 
require an update to the 3GPP standard.  To mitigate downlink interference, the report proposed the 
following solutions:  
•Full-Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO) – This solution would use multiple antennas at the 
eNodeB (base station) transmitter to mitigate the interference in the downlink to UAs.289  FD-
MIMO can also limit the mean terrestrial user equipment (UE) packet throughput loss.290

TR36.777 Report uses the term “aerial user equipment” or “aerial vehicles,” for purposes of uniformity, we refer to 
aerial user equipment or vehicles as unmanned aircraft or UA.

•Directional Antenna at UAs – Interference in the downlink can be mitigated by equipping 
UAs with a directional antenna instead of an omnidirectional antenna.291  A directional 
antenna can be used to mitigate the interference in the downlink to UAs by decreasing the 
interference power coming from a broad range of angles.292
•Receive Beamforming at UAs – The UAs are assumed to be equipped with more than two 
receive antennas to mitigate the interference in the downlink to UAs.293  Downlink 
interference mitigation can be achieved in this case by using receive beamforming at UAs.294  
In this solution, multiple cells belonging to the same site are coordinated and data is jointly 
transmitted to the UAs.295   
•Intra-site Joint Transmission Coordinated Multi-point Operation (JT CoMP) – In this 
solution, multiple cells are coordinated and data is jointly transmitted to the UAs.296  
•Coverage Extension – In this solution, coverage extension techniques via downlink shared 
channels, physical broadcast channels, and physical downlink shared channels are used to 
enhance synchronization and initial access for UAs.297  Because the UA is synchronized with 
the network, downlink interference is mitigated.298  
•Coordinated Data and Control Transmission – In this solution, multiple cells belonging to 
the same or different sites are coordinated.299  Data, common signal/channels (e.g., 
synchronization signal and Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)), and control channels can 
be jointly transmitted to the UAs.300 The coordinated cells could construct a larger cell for 
UAs, and terrestrial user equipment is served by physical cells without coordination,

296 The TR36.777 Report details how this solution helps to mitigate downlink interference.  From the results of the 
UAS testing done to support the study, it was observed that when the UA UE ratio is increased from 0% to 50% and 
when intra-site JT CoMP is employed in the case with 50% UA UE ratio, the mean packet throughput of all user 
equipment can be improved by 33.4% at low offered traffic load in a UMa-AV (Urban Macro base stations mounted 
above buildings with UAs) scenario.  TR36.777 Report at 15.  When the UA UE ratio remained fixed at 50% in 
UMa-AV scenario, employing intra-site JT CoMP can improve the mean packet throughput for all user equipment 
by 58.5% at low offered traffic load compared to the case where intra-site JT CoMP is not employed.  TR36.777 
Report at 15.
297 The TR36.777 Report explains how this solution helps to mitigate downlink interference.  From the results of the 
UAS testing done to support the study, it was observed that a noticeable fraction of the UA UE in RMa-AV (Rural 
Macro base stations located on top of towers with UAs) and UMa-AV (Urban Macro base stations mounted above 
buildings with UAs) are not in coverage for synchronization and initial access.  TR36.777 Report at 16.  With LTE

299 According to the TR36.777 Report, this solution helps to mitigate downlink interference as it was observed that 
the coordinated cells could construct a larger cell for UAs, and at the same time, terrestrial user equipment are 
served by physical cells without coordination.  TR36.777 Report at 16.  For the case of high resource utilization for 
PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel), throughput for UAs is improved  and the impact on terrestrial devices 
is reduced. TR36.777 Report at 16.

simultaneously.301  A dedicated downlink resource within the Physical Downlink Shared 
Channel (PDSCH) region of the coordinated cells can be reserved for these coordinated 
transmissions.302    
130. The report proposed the following techniques to mitigate uplink interference:
•User Equipment Specific Fractional Pathloss Compensation Factor – In this solution, an 
enhancement to the existing open loop power control mechanism is considered where a 
device-specific fractional pathloss compensation factor is introduced.303  
•User Equipment Specific Power Output Parameter – Configuring a lower power output for 
UAs compared to terrestrial devices improves terrestrial uplink user equipment throughput 
performance.304  Such a configuration, however, reduces UA uplink throughput.305
•Closed Loop Power Control – In this solution, the target received powers for the UAs are 
adjusted.306  By applying closed loop power control, mean terrestrial user equipment uplink 
throughput improvement can be improved.307
•Full-Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO) – By using FD-MIMO with multiple antennas at the 
eNB receiver interference in the uplink can be mitigated.308  In addition, FD-MIMO can limit 
the mean terrestrial user equipment packet throughput loss.309
131.  In addition to TR 36.777, 3GPP made changes to Technical Standard TS36.331 to help 
address UA interference to the base station.  In LTE networks, measurement reports are messages sent 
from a UA to a base station that help the base station make network decisions.310  The changes to 
TS36.331 included measurement report triggers for two reporting events:  H1 (above) and H2 (below) UA 
height thresholds sent from the UA to the base station to help the base station see the UA and to deal with

303 From the results of the UAS testing done to support the study, it was observed that with the introduction of a user 
equipment specific fractional pathloss compensation factor, it is possible to configure UAs with a different factor 
compared to the fractional pathloss compensation factor configured to the terrestrial devices.  TR36.77 Report at 16-
17.  It was observed that with the UA ratio fixed at 50% in UMa-AV scenario, applying different fractional path loss 
compensation factors for UAs and terrestrial devices can result in significant user equipment packet throughput 
gains for terrestrial devices and significant user equipment packet throughput losses for UAs.  TR36.777 Report at 
16-17.  Applying height dependent fractional pathloss compensation factors for UAs can result in significant user 
equipment packet throughput gains for terrestrial devices and notable UE packet throughput gains for UAs.

potential interference.311  3GPP is also making additional enhancements to integrate UAS into LTE 
networks that do not relate to interference.312
132. While the 3GPP TR 36.777 report concluded that it is feasible to use existing LTE 
networks to provide UA connectivity, the report and its findings have their limitations.  The 3GPP 
quantitative analyses for Release 15 evaluated only the self-network performance impact of various 
potential solutions to interference detection and mitigation.313  Moreover, the technical solutions identified 
do not eliminate the interference from UAs, they merely reduce the levels of interference.314  The report 
also noted that interference challenges become more visible when the density of UAs increases.315  
Beyond these limitations, the report did not evaluate the interference potential and impact on neighboring 
wireless networks or other radio services in the vicinity of UAS operation, nor did it evaluate the costs 
associated with the proposed technical solutions.  As a result, there are open questions about the level of 
interference that licensees may experience and deem acceptable from neighboring licensees deploying 
UAS, the mitigation measures that may be necessary, and the costs licensees are willing to absorb to 
protect themselves from interference.  Thus, the current 3GPP studies, while a valuable start, point to the 
need to address additional UAS interference issues.  
133. Given that it appears that UAS operations within a single terrestrial mobile network will 
likely result in an increased level of intra-network interference and decreased network efficiency, it is also 
likely that adjacent markets and networks will be affected by UAS operations.  While we seek to provide 
licensees with as much flexibility as possible to deploy a wide range of services and applications, 
including UAS, the increased risk of harmful interference from such operations is a concern.  
Neighboring licensees, whether they deploy or decide not to deploy UAS/airborne technologies, will be 
impacted and may be required to implement protections for their own networks.  A difficult situation may 
arise for all parties when adjacent licensees—both of which are operating within the Commission’s 
rules—reach an impasse regarding interference, and the failure to reach a resolution may detrimentally 
affect operations for one or both licensees.
134.  We seek comment on how licensees deploying UAS technologies could protect licensees 
in neighboring markets and neighboring spectrum bands from interference.  Some flexible-use licensees 
planning to deploy airborne technology (e.g., UAS) may believe that such use is not problematic from an 
interference standpoint because they may assume that (1) all licensees will deploy the same technology, 
(2) all terrestrial networks are equally prepared to protect themselves, and (3) other potentially 
incompatible airborne technologies will not also be deployed.  While this best-case scenario may turn out 
to be true as the market for airborne services develops, our rules must be expansive enough to account for

Radio Access Network; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); 
Protocol specification (Release 16) (Section 5.5.4 - Measurement report triggering).
312 In Release 16, 3GPP completed a study into the potential requirements and use cases for Remote Identification of 
Unmanned Aerial Systems.  See https://www.3gpp.org/uas-uav.  The study also looked at the extent to which the 
3GPP system can enable UAS components to establish the connectivity between each other and UAS Traffic 
Management (UTM) for both line-of-sight connectivity and non-line-of-sight connectivity, and on the detection and 
reporting of unauthorized UAs towards the UTM.  See https://www.3gpp.org/uas-uav.  In Release 17, 3GPP 
specifies additional capabilities which support UAS applications and requirements such as UA user authentication, 
UA tracking, and UA remote identification, among others.  See 3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical

the increased potential for harmful interference.  Our rules should, at a minimum, set out a framework for 
UAS operations that is broad enough to account for varying interference scenarios.  For these reasons, we 
seek comment on whether our rules can accommodate UAS operations while also protecting co-channel 
and adjacent band operations, including satellite operations, where permitted.  In addition, we seek 
comment on changes to our rules that may be necessary to accommodate these scenarios.
135. For example, the power limitations for mobile devices vary depending on the service.  
For the PCS band, the limit is 2 Watts EIRP.316  Hand-held stations operating in the 698-757 MHz, 776-
788 MHz, 805-806 MHz, and 600 MHz uplink band are limited to 3 Watts ERP.317  Are these and other 
power limitations for mobile devices in the flexible-use bands appropriate for UAS operation?  
Considering the increased interference potential of UAS, should the power limitations for UAs be lower 
than for terrestrial devices?  
136. Additionally, for many services, a licensee’s predicted or measured median field strength 
limit must be calculated and may not be exceeded at any given point along its service area boundary.318  
These limits were developed considering only terrestrial devices.319  With the introduction of UAS, how 
will licensees ensure these boundary limits are not exceeded?  Are the current limits320 sufficient to 
protect the boundary of a neighboring licensee on the same or adjacent channel block?  Can a UAS report 
and store power control and location metrics to ensure boundary limits are not exceeded?321
137. As noted, the higher the altitude at which UAs are operating, the greater the number of 
line of sight paths between a UA and surrounding base stations, and thus the greater the potential impact 
on adjacent networks.  We seek comment on the altitudes that are being considered for UA operations 
involving flexible-use spectrum.  Will operations on these bands likely be limited to low altitudes such as 
400 feet AGL, or is it anticipated that UAS use on flexible-use bands will include operations at higher 
altitudes such as 10,000 feet AGL or greater?  Given the increased potential for interference at high 
altitudes, should the Commission impose altitude restrictions on UAS operations using flexible-use 
spectrum?
138. Further, it is not clear whether existing out-of-band emissions rules adequately account 
for the favorable line-of-sight propagation conditions associated with UAS.  Should such rules be 
modified to account for UAS operations in flexible-use spectrum, and if so, how?  We seek comment on 
these and other technical rules that should be evaluated and perhaps revised to facilitate the use of 
flexible-use bands for UAS.  
139. To inform our analysis regarding whether rule revisions may be necessary, we seek 
technical studies and analyses regarding the potential for UAS operations to cause interference to adjacent 
channel, adjacent band, or adjacent market operations.  Among other issues, these studies and analyses 
should address how licensees deploying UAS technologies plan to protect terrestrial or satellite licensees 
in neighboring markets or spectrum bands from harmful interference.  We request comment on the 
challenges and issues that carriers have experienced when testing or deploying UAS operations relative to 
the carrier’s own terrestrial wireless network.  What solutions have carriers developed or are carriers

developing to address those challenges, specifically, the hardware, software, processes required, as well 
as the costs entailed in deploying such solutions?  What UAS altitude and UA density assumptions have 
been used to analyze deployment challenges and protection of neighbors?  Are these solutions to be 
implemented applicable to the UA, or are they network-based?  For licensees employing LTE, can the 
solutions identified in the 3GPP TR36.777 Report be applied to resolve interference issues within the 
network and to adjacent networks?  Given that flexible-use spectrum licensees may deploy networks other 
than LTE, what additional interference issues may be encountered and what are the technical solutions 
that could be applied, given that there may be varying levels of compatibility with airborne technologies?  
We note that some areas, such as Quiet Zones require the application of more stringent measures to 
reduce the potential for interference;322 how will licensees continue to protect such areas when operating 
at higher altitudes?323  Are there network-based solutions being developed that could prevent individual 
UAs from approaching or entering such noise-sensitive locations or other restricted areas that would 
mitigate the potential for UAs to cause interference or endanger safety of life and property in such areas?  
We also seek comment on any other regulatory matters that may be affected by UAS operations.  For 
example, will UAS/airborne technologies affect other regulatory requirements like 911 location accuracy?  
140.Different Use Cases.  Our regulatory approach with respect to flexible-use bands is to 
provide licensees with sufficient flexibility to choose the services that they wish to provide.  Licensees 
could offer a wide range of services and applications, ranging from “conventional” C2 and payload 
offerings to UTM management services.  This ability of licensees to engage in a wide range of use cases 
creates additional technical uncertainty when deploying UAS operations.  We seek comment on the 
airborne use cases that commenters are considering for flexible-use spectrum.  Is there a need for specific 
rules to permit different applications?  Further, should licensees that incorporate UAS operations be 
required to meet different limitations than what currently exist?  
141. One application being explored is the use of UAs as airborne base stations.324  HAPS 
systems can potentially be used to provide both fixed broadband connectivity for end users and 
transmission links between the mobile and core networks for backhauling traffic.  As noted, the 
Commission’s rules —as well as ITU Radio Regulations— define HAPS as radio stations located on an 
object at an altitude of 12-31 miles (20-50 kilometers) and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to 
the Earth.325  
142. We note that the Commission is currently considering whether HAPS or other 
stratospheric-based services could be used in any portion of the 71-76 GHz, 81-86 GHz, 92-94 GHz, and 
94.1-95 GHz (70/80/90 GHz) bands to provide or support broadband Internet access.326  Are there

flexible-use bands that could potentially accommodate such use?327  Would such use be compatible with 
“conventional” UAS and terrestrial, flexible-use operations given the potential impact that such high 
altitude use could have on other operations in the band?  If so, what rule changes or regulatory 
considerations would be necessary to permit such uses?  
143. Other examples of airborne base station platforms include the use of tethered UAS, which 
typically are UAs physically connected to the ground via cables that provide power and data links to the 
UAs.328  We are aware that there has been research and development in the use of tethered UAS as 
temporary base stations, particularly as part of disaster recovery efforts.329  What issues are raised by the 
use of tethered UAS temporary base stations?  If the station is essentially functioning as a conventional 
base station, should the existing rules applicable to the particular band be applied?  Or is it necessary to 
apply other service and technical parameters, e.g., antenna height and power output?  What additional 
concerns are raised where tethered UAS base stations as well as HAPS are deployed?  Further, what 
would be the impact of a mobile airborne base station on airborne user equipment (i.e., UAS)?  What 
changes or additions to our rules are necessary to address such concerns?
144.Elimination of Rules Which Impede UAS.  In its Final Report, the BVLOS ARC 
recommended that the Commission reconsider the restrictions on airborne use that apply to certain 
spectrum bands.330  The BVLOS ARC Final Report noted that beyond-visual-line-of-sight operations 
require that spectrum bands with appropriate characteristics are sufficiently available to meet the needs of 
numerous users operating in a variety of operating environments.331  Similarly, the TAC has noted that the 
Commission should reassess the technical basis for prohibiting use of certain terrestrial mobile bands 
above ground level.332  To the extent that measures can be identified that resolve or mitigate the impact of 
UAS use on adjacent operations, we seek comment on whether current prohibitions on airborne 
operations should be removed.  For example, the Cellular Radiotelephone Service airborne use 
prohibition in section 22.925 was put in place specifically because of the heightened risk of interference 
by airborne mobiles to cellular networks.  Can such operations be protected in the presence of UAS use?  
If solutions are developed that effectively mitigate the increased potential for harmful interference posed 
by UAS use, should UAS operations be permitted in Cellular Radiotelephone Service or other bands?  
Are there certain noise-restricted bands that must retain the prohibition regardless of any UAS 
327 We observe that the Commission has previously granted experimental authorizations for high-altitude testing 
using flexible-use spectrum.  See, e.g., Physical Science Laboratory/New Mexico State University, Special 
Temporary Authorization, OET Experimental Licensing System File No.:  0020-EX-CM-2022; Loon, LLC, Special

interference mitigation measures?333  If a commenter seeks to eliminate or modify an existing prohibition, 
the commenter should specifically explain why the airborne use would not cause harmful interference to a 
co-channel or adjacent channel licensee’s operations.  
145.Canadian and Mexican Coordination.  The use of UAS will likely have an impact in 
areas beyond United States borders.  There are several agreements that address use of the flexible-use 
bands in the border regions between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.334  These agreements do not 
contemplate UAS use.  Because UAS operation in these bands would increase the interference potential in 
the border regions, commenters should be aware that UAS use may not be permitted in border areas until 
such time as the agreements are updated to accommodate such use, or agreements on such use are reached 
with both countries.  We seek comment on how to address issues arising from UAS use in the border 
regions pending any changes to existing agreements.
D. UAS Impact on Spectrum Rights 
146. The Commission’s rules largely presume that wireless networks are terrestrial in nature, 
which raises questions regarding the extent of spectrum rights granted as part of existing commercial 
authorizations.  Pursuant to the Communications Act and the Commission’s rules, the Commission grants 
licensees the right to operate radio systems on a particular radio frequency.335  In some services, such as 
those with allocations prohibiting aeronautical mobile use, it can be presumed that a licensee only has 
rights with respect to ground-based operations.336  Likewise, other services have technical rules which 
suggest that only terrestrial networks were contemplated for those services.337  By contrast, rules for 
geographic market-based licenses define market areas according to geographic boundaries, but they are 
silent as to the vertical scope of such markets.338  The Commission has never explicitly stated what it 
believes to be the vertical limit of a licensee’s spectrum rights, leaving a question as to the “ceiling” of 
license areas and the attendant protections associated with these geographic markets.  As the interference 
discussion above highlights, however, market boundaries become crucial at higher altitudes.
147. The ability of a licensee to exercise or protect its spectrum rights with respect to adjacent 
licensees becomes relevant in the context of UAS use, given that the operation of UAs well within the 
333 There are restrictions on aeronautical or airborne mobile use in or adjacent to noise-restricted bands.  For 
example, in the 1670-1675 MHz band, aeronautical mobile is prohibited to protect radio astronomy operations.  See 
47 CFR § 2.106, footnotes US211, US342.
334 See, e.g., Canada Agreements By Frequency, https://www.fcc.gov/canadian-agreements-frequency, (700 MHz

336 Several allocations in the Table of Frequency Allocations, including 1670-1675 MHz, 2305-2310 MHz, 2495-
2690 MHz and 3550-3700 MHz bands, permit primary non-Federal mobile, except aeronautical mobile, operations.  
47 CFR § 2.106.
337 For example, PCS service rules specify maximum antenna height and output power of base stations. 47 CFR § 
24.232.  In the Cellular Radiotelephone Service, license areas are determined by a licensee’s Cellular Service Area 
Boundary (SAB), which is the area around a base station transmitter within which a subscriber can receive a specific 
signal level.  See 47 CFR § 22.911.  The license area defined by this service contour is, in essence, a dome around 
the transmitter.  Id.
338 See, e.g., 47 CFR §§ 24.202, 27.6.  A geographic market licensee generally may construct a transmitter tower 
anywhere within a particular geographic area’s boundary (subject to certain interference protection and other 
technical requirements) and does not need to apply for prior Commission approval of specific transmitter locations.  
See, e.g., 47 CFR § 27.11(a) (“Applications for individual sites are not required and will not be accepted, except 
where required for environmental assessments, in accordance with §§ 1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.”); 47 
CFR § 90.663.
534Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
boundaries of one license area can affect and be affected by base stations located inside the boundaries of 
another license area—more so than for conventional mobile operation.  UAs will have line-of-sight 
connectivity to base stations both within the geographic market area where the UA is flying, as well as 
base stations in other adjacent geographic areas.  The potential for a UA to establish a network connection 
with a base station in an adjacent market causes a tension between Commission policies:  (1) a licensee’s 
authorization generally provides the licensee exclusive use of the spectrum within its licensed market 
area; and (2) historically, our rules consider mobile devices to be operating under the authority of the 
licensee whose transmitter is providing service.  UA operation creates a tension between these two 
policies because a UA can be served by a transmitter that is well outside of the licensee’s market 
boundary.339  The greater line-of-sight of UAs could extend the reach of a transmitter further into an 
adjacent market, thus muddling the concept of license exclusivity.  
148. This aspect of UAS use raises questions regarding how and under what circumstances a 
licensee is able to enforce rights under its license.340  For example, it may be difficult to determine UAS 
operation as a cause of interference to a network because such operation is intermittent and because the 
effect may vary depending on the position and movement of the UA.  Moreover, even if UAS operation is 
determined to be a cause of interference, the offending licensee is likely to be operating within the 
Commission’s rules regarding conventional mobile operations.  This poses questions regarding the 
circumstances under which the “victim” licensee, i.e., the licensee experiencing harmful interference, may 
seek relief from the Commission where both entities are compliant with service rules.  
149. Accordingly, we seek comment on whether the Commission should identify a vertical 
limit at which flexible-use licenses may be used to support UAS on an exclusive or primary basis.  Use 
beyond this limit would be on a non-primary basis.  “Non-primary” in this context would mean that a 
licensee would be required to cure harmful interference to an adjacent licensee caused by its UAS 
operation even if it is operating within the rules.341  First, is it appropriate to establish a vertical limit for 
primary UAS operations in our rules?  If we adopt a limit, what should that limit be?  What factors should 
the Commission consider regarding a vertical limit for licensed UAS operations?  
150. Second, we seek comment on how to determine whether a licensee should be required to 
cure harmful interference caused by its non-primary operations to adjacent licensees even if it is operating 
within the service rules for the license.  How should we determine whether an entity should be obligated 
to take corrective measures, as there may be scenarios in which it could be difficult to determine fault?  
We request comment on how licensees should be able to enforce their license rights.  What interference 
resolution mechanism would be appropriate?
IV. LICENSING UAS OPERATORS FOR VHF COMMUNICATIONS
151. The aeronautical VHF band (117.975 MHz -137 MHz) is used by aviation for air traffic 
control and advisory communications among other aviation-safety purposes.342  In some instances, to 
ensure the safety of the National Airspace System, the FAA requires operators of UAS to communicate 
339 In the current mobile environment this happens to a limited extent at a market boundary.  Currently, base stations 
situated along a market boundary can serve a conventional mobile located close to the boundary in the adjacent 
market; this is beneficial to both licensees as it permits continued service and seamless handoff across boundaries.  
UA, however, could be served by base stations well within the adjacent market boundary due to a greater line-of-
sight.
340 See Technological Advisory Committee, UAS Working Group March 26, 2019 Presentation, 
https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/tac/tacdocs/meeting32619/TAC-Presentations-3-26-19.pdf (last visited June 14, 2022).
341 “Non-primary” status would not mean that a licensee would not have interference protection for its own 
operation.  The non-primary status would only convey responsibility for curing interference even if that licensee is 
operating within rules.

with air traffic control (ATC) facilities when operating on or in the vicinity of an airport or operating in 
controlled airspace over the VHF traffic control and advisory frequencies.343  To meet this requirement, 
operators may use a VHF station integrated into the UA itself whereby the UAS operator’s control station 
connects with the UA using a non-VHF channel and the UA completes the connection to ATC over the 
normal VHF channels.  This approach is commonly referred to as ATC relay.344  Implementation of ATC 
relay in UA technology is still nascent and UAS operators have, therefore, continued to rely on ground-
based VHF stations.  The part 87 aviation service rules governing the use of the aeronautical VHF band 
do not, however, provide a licensing mechanism for the operator of a UAS to obtain a ground-based 
station license.345  Accordingly, UAS operator requests for such authorization are currently handled by 
special temporary authority on a case-by-case basis.  We propose to establish a mechanism by which 
UAS operators may apply for a regular license for this purpose, with appropriate requirements, 
restrictions, and conditions to maintain the integrity of the band and service legitimate needs for flight 
coordination.   
152. Although aeronautical VHF stations are generally licensed by rule under part 87 if the 
aircraft does not make international flights or communications,346 we do not propose to authorize ground-
based VHF stations under a licensed-by-rule approach.  Rather, under our proposal, we would require 
operators to file a license application with the Commission for an individual license covering their VHF 
station.  According to the FAA, there were over 200,000 private aircraft registered in the United States as 
of 2020 and were over 7,000 commercial aircraft as of 2019, numbers which are expected to remain 
relatively stable to the year 2040.347  In contrast, the recreational UAS fleet is expected to grow from the 
current 1.32 million units to approximately 1.48 million units by 2024.348  The FAA also forecasts that, by 
the year 2024, the commercial UAS fleet will likely be twice as large as the current fleet of approximately 
385,000 UAS.349  Given the potential number of UAS operators, we have concerns that a licensed-by-rule

communications; see also, e.g., Supplemental Statement of BNSF Railway Co., FCC File No. 0008476737, at 1 
(filed Dec. 20, 2018), available at  (last visited June 14, 2022) (stating that “[t]he ability for BNSF to have active 
participation on the proposed aviation channels is of major importance to the FAA” and that “the FAA has requested 
BNSF obtain an aircraft stations license from the FCC” that will be “used to communicate directly to ATC”); see 
also FAA Order JO 7210.3CC – Facility Operation and Administration, at 5-5-3(b), 
https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/foa_html/chap5_section_5.html (last visited June 14, 2022) 
(providing that the “Operations Supervisor/Controller-in-Charge (OS/CIC) should ensure . . . if known, that the 
controller has a method of contacting the appropriate UAS [pilot-in-command]”). 
344 For example, the technical standard RTCA DO-362A would potentially provide for the use of CNPC links in the 
5030-5091 MHz band to support the link between operator and UA for purposes of ATC relay.  See RTCA DO-
362A, § 1.1. and B.3.1.2.  
345 This issue does not arise for pilots aboard manned aircraft, who use stations for VHF communications under 
subpart F of part 87 of the Commission’s rules.  See 47 CFR pt. 87, subpt. F.  Subpart F authorizes aircraft stations, 
which, as mentioned earlier, are defined as stations “located on board an aircraft.”  47 CFR §§ 87.5, 87.185(a).  
Because ground stations are not “located on board an aircraft,” they are not covered by subpart F. 
346 See 47 CFR § 87.18(b).
347 See FAA, FAA Aerospace Forecast:  Fiscal Years 2020-2040 at 26, 32,

(last visited June 14, 2022) (FAA Aerospace Forecast).  While the private aircraft fleet is expected to slightly 
decrease, the number of flight hours is expected to increase.  Id. at 26, 27.  The commercial fleet is expected to grow

approach applied to these operators’ stations in the VHF band could endanger this critical and limited 
amount of aeronautical spectrum and the safety of the National Airspace System.  
153. In addition, given the wide availability of inexpensive, off-the-shelf VHF hand-held 
radios that can be easily operated without training, we are concerned about the greater potential for parties 
to obtain and use ground stations on a licensed-by-rule basis to contact ATC, because they may not have 
adequate training for such communications.  We are further concerned that licensed-by-rule operators 
would be difficult to identify during communications with ATC or afterwards in the event of problems.  
We tentatively conclude that ground stations for VHF communications should not be licensed by rule, 
and seek comment on our analysis and tentative conclusion.350  
154. While we typically do not individually license aircraft stations operating on VHF for 
domestic flights and communications, we seek comment on licensing ATC relay operations.  As 
discussed above, ATC relay implementation is currently in its nascent stage, however we expect relay 
operations to increase with a corresponding increase in UA operations near airports and in controlled 
airspace.  Given that ATC relay and ground-based VHF stations will both be used to communicate with 
ATC, are there inherent differences between ground radio operators and relay operators for the purpose of 
the communications?  Is there a reason to expect operators using ATC relay stations are better trained for 
such communications?  Are there other licensing related issues that we should consider that make relay 
systems unique?
155. We seek to adopt a licensing mechanism that addresses these concerns and maintains the 
integrity of the band while also meeting the legitimate needs of certain UAS operators for 
communications in the VHF band.  To achieve these goals, we propose several measures below.  We seek 
comment on these measures, and on any alternative approaches that would provide a regular licensing 
mechanism that meets the Commission’s goals.  
156. First, we propose to individually license ground stations for UAS operator 
communication with control towers and other aircraft pilots under a new category of licensed station, an 
Unmanned Aircraft Operator VHF Ground Station, and to define the new station as “a station on the 
ground providing unmanned aircraft pilot radio communication relating to safety and regularity of flight 
on air traffic control, flight service station,  unicom, or multicom frequencies.”351  Individual licensing 
will enable the Commission to identify authorized operators, identify unauthorized users, and aid in 
resolving instances of harmful interference.  Accordingly, under this proposal, parties will be required to 
submit individual license applications.  We propose that parties use the FCC Form 605, which is used 
generally for, inter alia, authorizations for stations in the “aircraft service,” and we seek comment on 
whether any modifications to the form are necessary or helpful to facilitate its use for this purpose.352    
157. Second, we propose to provide that these stations may operate over all air traffic control, 
flight service station, aeronautical advisory station (unicom), and aeronautical multicom station 
350 We also note that section 307(e) of the Act expressly limits licensing by rule in the aviation service to aircraft 
stations and, as discussed, we seek to adopt a licensing mechanism for VHF ground stations.  See 47 U.S.C. § 
307(e).
351 A flight service station is part of a network of stations providing weather briefings and information on flight 
facilities and monitoring the navigational radio net.  See Review of Part 87 of the Commission's Rules Concerning 
the Aviation Radio Service, WT Docket No. 01-289, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making, 
18 FCC Rcd 21432, 21459, para. 56, n.209 (2003).  A unicom station is an aeronautical station used for advisory 
and civil defense communications primarily with private aircraft.  47 CFR § 87.5.   A multicom station is an 
aeronautical station used to provide communications to conduct the activities being performed by, or directed from, 
private aircraft.  Id.
352 FCC Form 605 provides a quick-form application for authorization for, among others, stations in the “aircraft 
service” generally.  See FCC Form 605, https://www.fcc.gov/fcc-form-605. 
537Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
(multicom) channels authorized for use by aircraft.353  We seek comment on which specific channels to 
cover for this purpose.354  
158. Third, we propose to permit mobile stations (stations intended to be used while in motion 
or during halts at unspecified points), and we further seek comment on whether to permit non-mobile 
stations as well.  To the extent parties support the inclusion of non-mobile stations, we seek comment on 
whether coverage of such stations for communications between two non-mobile sites (i.e., the operator’s 
fixed VHF station and air traffic control) is consistent with the aeronautical mobile and aeronautical 
mobile (route) allocations applicable to the air traffic control frequencies.355
159. Fourth, we propose to require that license applications include an endorsement from the 
FAA.  An endorsement must be included in a written document issued by the FAA, such as a Certificate 
of Approval (COA).  We propose to provide that a license will not be issued without an FAA 
endorsement.  We further propose that the approved license will be subject to any restrictions or 
conditions specified on the FAA endorsement.  While licenses under part 87 are normally issued for 10 
years, we seek comment on whether to provide that license terms for these stations will be the lesser of 10 
years or the duration of the FAA endorsement, if any is specified.  We further seek comment on whether a 
party seeking license renewal should be required to submit a new FAA written endorsement.  
160. Finally, we propose to adopt a clarification of section 87.18 that will make clear that 
licensing by rule continues to apply to UAS aircraft stations, such as the VHF stations used for ATC 
relay.  As discussed above, while we seek comment on whether the concerns that underlie our proposal 
that a UAS operator’s ground-based VHF stations should be individually licensed warrant the same 
approach for UAS aircraft stations, we are not proposing at this time to require individual licensing for 
those UAS aircraft stations used for VHF communications.  To avoid any confusion as to the continued 
application of licensing by rule to such stations that might result from our proposal to license a UAS 
operator’s ground-based VHF station individually, we propose to clarify in section 87.18(b) that licensing 
by rule applies to aircraft stations, whether “manned or unmanned.”
161. We believe these steps will help to promote the safe integration of UAS into the National 
Airspace System, while maintaining the integrity of the aeronautical VHF band.  We request comment on 
these proposals and alternatives.  We seek comment on whether a provision enabling UAS operators to 
license ground-based stations to communicate over the aeronautical VHF band is necessary or if instead 
we should continue to address requests for authorization for ground-based stations on a case-by-case 
basis.  If providing a mechanism for licensing of ground-based VHF stations is warranted, we seek 
comment on whether the proposed rules adequately address this need or unduly restrict the ability of UAS 
operators to communicate with ATC or with manned aircraft.  Conversely, we seek comment on whether 
the proposal is too broad, and whether we should further restrict the circumstances under which UAS 
operators may obtain licensed ground stations to use the aeronautical VHF band.  We also request 
comment on whether the FAA’s planned integration of the Next Gen Data Communications system into 
the 136-137 MHz band or other innovations have any current or future effect on this need, including 
whether they may alter the frequencies that a future UAS operator needs to use to communicate with ATC 
or otherwise warrant modifications to our proposal.356  
162. We further seek comment on the appropriate technical and operational requirements for 
the new category of station, and whether we should generally require such stations to comply with the 
technical and operational requirements applicable to aircraft stations licensed in the same frequency, or if 
353 See 47 CFR § 87.173(b); see also 47 CFR subpts. G, H.
354 See 47 CFR §§ 87.173(b), 87.187(a), 87.187(y)(2) (flight service station frequencies).
355 See 47 CFR § 2.106.  For example, the aeronautical mobile service allocation covers “mobile service between 
aeronautical [i.e., ground] stations and aircraft stations, or between aircraft stations,” and does not expressly 
encompass service between two fixed stations.  47 CFR § 2.1.
356 See, e.g., Aviation NPRM, 34 FCC Rcd at 4995-96, paras. 31-32.
538Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
any additional or alternate requirements should be adopted.  In particular, we note that, under section 
87.89 of the Commission’s rules, operators of aviation service stations are generally required to hold a 
commercial radio operator license or permit, and that the operator license or permit requires passing a 
requisite knowledge test.357  The rule also specifies, however, that no operator license is required to 
“[o]perate a VHF telephony transmitter providing domestic service or used on domestic flights.”358  We 
seek comment on whether a UAS operator’s VHF communications with ATC would constitute the 
operation of a VHF telephony transmitter providing domestic service or used on domestic flights, and if 
so, whether we should create an exception to this provision and provide that UAS operators that operate a 
licensed Unmanned Aircraft Operator Ground VHF Station must have a commercial radio operator 
license.  Should we specify an alternative permit or training requirement for such operators?  
163.Digital Equity and Inclusion.  Finally, the Commission, as part of its continuing effort to 
advance digital equity for all,359 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in 
rural or Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely 
affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations360 and 
benefits (if any) that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein.  Specifically, we 
seek comment on how our proposals in this NPRM may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, 
inclusion, and accessibility, as well the scope of the Commission’s relevant legal authority.  
V. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
164.Ex Parte Presentations.  This proceeding shall be treated as a “permit-but-disclose” 
proceeding in accordance with the Commission’s ex parte rules.361  Persons making ex parte presentations 
must file a copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral presentation within 
two business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the Sunshine period 
applies).  Persons making oral ex parte presentations are reminded that memoranda summarizing the 
presentation must: (1) list all persons attending or otherwise participating in the meeting at which the ex 
parte presentation was made, and (2) summarize all data presented and arguments made during the 
presentation.  If the presentation consisted in whole or in part of the presentation of data or arguments 
already reflected in the presenter’s written comments, memoranda or other filings in the proceeding, the 
presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, memoranda, or 
other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or arguments can be 
found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum.  Documents shown or given to Commission 
staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte presentations and must be filed 
consistent with rule 1.1206(b).  In proceedings governed by rule 1.49(f) or for which the Commission has 
made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and memoranda summarizing

foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make [such service] available, so far as possible, to 
all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or 
sex.”  47 U.S.C. § 151.
360 The term “equity” is used here consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, 
and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have 
been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual,

APPENDIX B
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission has prepared this present Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed 
in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM).  Written public comments are requested on this IRFA.  
Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments 
provided in the NPRM.  The Commission will send a copy of the NPRM, including this IRFA, to the 
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the NPRM and 
IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.3 
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules
2. The NPRM in this proceeding acts, in part, on a February, 2018 petition for rulemaking 
by the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), which recommended that the Commission adopt licensing 
and service rules for control and non-payload communications (CNPC) links in the 5030-5091 MHz band 
to support unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operations in the United States.  In addition, on August 20, 
2021, the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and Office of Engineering and Technology jointly 
submitted to Congress a report on behalf of the Commission addressing the matters specified in Section 
374 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (FAA Reauthorization Act).  The report included their 
finding that “[t]he 5030-5091 MHz band appears to offer promise for intensive UAS use because it is 
unencumbered” and recommended that the Commission initiate a rulemaking proceeding to develop 
service and licensing rules enabling UAS use of the band in collaboration with the FAA and NTIA.
3. The NPRM now proposes and seeks comment on several rule amendments to address the 
growing need of the operators of UAS for access to licensed spectrum.  Together, the proposals and the 
measures upon which the NPRM seeks comment will help further the development and promote the 
growth and safety of UAS operations.  
4. First, the NPRM addresses the 5030-5091 MHz band, which the Commission previously 
allocated to support terrestrial control links for UAS without adopting service rules.  Because technical 
work regarding UAS is still in a nascent stage, the Commission anticipates that service rules sufficient to 
facilitate UAS operations will likely require development in phases.  It now takes the first step to develop 
such rules.  The NPRM seeks comment on service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band that will provide 
UAS operators with access to licensed spectrum with the reliability necessary to support safety-critical 
UAS communications links.  The Commission’s objective in this proceeding is to provide UAS operators 
with access to an additional spectrum resource that may complement other spectrum resources that are 
currently available or in development.  Although existing networks operating in other bands such as 
flexible-use bands may provide sufficient reliability for many UAS use cases, authorization of the 5030-
5091 MHz band for UAS use offers an opportunity to apply standards and rules designed to meet the 
most safety-critical communications needs.
5. Second, due to the increasing interest in operating UAS using existing terrestrial flexible-
use spectrum networks, the NPRM seeks comment on whether the Commission’s rules are adequate to 
ensure co-existence of terrestrial mobile operations and UAS use or whether changes to our rules are 
necessary.  To this end, it seeks comment on the sufficiency of the current flexible-use rules to prevent 
1 See 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).
2 See 5 U.S.C. § 603(a).
3 See id.
550Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
interference to and from UAS operations, and on whether the Commission can eliminate the current 
prohibitions on airborne operations applicable to certain of these flexible-use bands.  
6. Third, to further promote the safe integration of unmanned aircraft operations in 
controlled airspace and facilitate flight coordination, the NPRM proposes a process for UAS operators to 
obtain a VHF license to communicate with air traffic control and other aircraft.  In some instances, to 
ensure the safety of the National Airspace System, the FAA has required operators of UAS to 
communicate with air traffic control facilities or nearby manned aircraft over the VHF traffic control and 
advisory frequencies and to obtain a license from the FCC for this purpose.  The part 87 aviation service 
rules do not, however, provide a mechanism for the operator of a UAS to obtain such a license.  UAS 
operator requests for such authorization are currently handled by special temporary authority on a case-
by-case basis.  The proposed rule will enable UAS operators to obtain a regular license for this purpose.  
B. Legal Basis
7. The proposed action is authorized pursuant to Sections 1, 4, 301, 303, 307-310, 316, 318, 
and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154, 301, 303, 307-310, 
316, 318, and 332.
C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rules Will Apply
8. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.4  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”5  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small-business concern” under the Small Business Act.6  A “small-business 
concern” is one which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.7
9.Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.8  First, while there 
are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, 
according to data from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy, in general a 
small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.9  These types of small 
businesses represent 99.9% of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million 
businesses.10
4 See id. § 603(b)(3).
5 See id. § 601(6).
6 See id. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small-business concern” in the Small Business Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”
7 See 15 U.S.C. § 632.
8 See 5 U.S.C. § 601(3)-(6).
9 See SBA, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions, “What is a small business?,”

10 Id. 
551Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
10. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”11  The 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.12  Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there 
were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the United States reporting revenues of 
$50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the 
IRS.13 
11. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”14  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census 
of Governments15 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16  Of this number there were 
36,931 general purpose governments (county,17 municipal, and town or township18) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts19 with enrollment 
11 5 U.S.C. § 601(4).
12 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction.  Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number of 
small organizations in this small entity description.  See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard), https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-
requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard.  We note that the IRS data does not provide 
information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field.
13 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF), “CSV Files by Region,” 
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf.  The IRS 
Exempt Organization Business Master File (EO BMF) Extract provides information on all registered tax-
exempt/non-profit organizations. The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO 
BMF data for businesses for the tax year 2020 with revenue less than or equal to $50,000, for Region 1-Northeast 
Area (58,577), Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas (175,272), and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast 
Areas (213,840) which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii. This data does not include information for 
Puerto Rico.

552Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
populations of less than 50,000.20  Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data, we 
estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”21
12.Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.22  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.23  The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 
1,500 or fewer employees.24  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this 
industry that operated for the entire year.25  Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 
employees.26  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, 
as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
wireless services.27  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer 
employees.28  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers can be 
considered small entities.
13.Satellite Telecommunications. This industry comprises firms “primarily engaged in 
providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or 
reselling satellite telecommunications.”29  Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite 
and earth station operators. The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business 
with $35 million or less in annual receipts as small.30  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 275 
firms in this industry operated for the entire year.31  Of this number, 242 firms had revenue of less than 
20 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census 
of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments 
category.  Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments 
category.
21 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal, and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of 
Governments - Organizations tbls. 5, 6, and 10.

$25 million.32  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, 
as of December 31, 2020, there were 71 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
satellite telecommunications services.33  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that approximately 
48 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.34  Consequently using the SBA’s small business size 
standard, a little more than of these providers can be considered small entities.  
14.All Other Telecommunications. This industry is comprised of establishments primarily 
engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications 
telemetry, and radar station operation.35  This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in 
providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial 
systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, 
satellite systems.36  Providers of Internet services (e.g. dial-up ISPs) or voice over Internet protocol 
(VoIP) services, via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.37  
The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies firms with annual receipts of $35 million 
or less as small.38  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 1,079 firms in this industry that 
operated for the entire year.39  Of those firms, 1,039 had revenue of less than $25 million.40  Based on this 
data, the Commission estimates that the majority of “All Other Telecommunications” firms can be 
considered small.
15.Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment 
Manufacturing.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and 
television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.41  Examples of products made by these 
establishments are: transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, 
pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and 
broadcasting equipment.42  The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses

having 1,250 employees or less as small.43  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 656 
firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.44  Of this number, 624 firms had fewer than 250 
employees.45  Thus, under the SBA size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered 
small.
16.Unmanned Aircraft Radio Equipment Manufacturers.  Neither the Commission nor the 
SBA have developed a small business size standard specifically applicable to unmanned aircraft radio 
equipment manufacturers.  Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment 
Manufacturing is the closest industry with a SBA small business size standard.46  The SBA small business 
size standard for this industry classifies businesses having 1,250 employees or less as small.47  U.S. 
Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 656 firms in this industry that operated for the entire 
year.48  Of this number, 624 firms had fewer than 250 employees.49  In addition, the SBA provides a size 
standard for the Aircraft Manufacturing industry which includes the manufacture of unmanned and 
robotic aircraft.50  The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses having 
1,500 employees or less as small.51  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 254 firms in 
this industry that operated for the entire year.52  Of this number, 227 firms had fewer than 250 
employees.53  Based on these data, we conclude that a majority of manufacturers in this industry are 
small. 
17.Unmanned Aircraft System Operators.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA have 
developed a small business size standard specifically applicable to UAS operators.  The Commission 
lacks data on the number of operators in the United States that could be subject to the rules therefore, it is 
not possible to determine the number of affected small entity operators at this time.  We find, however, 
that the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Remote ID rule is

helpful.  In this analysis, the FAA assessed the impact of the rule on small entity non-recreational UAS 
operators based on an analysis that the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International 
(AUVSI) performed relating to part 107 waivers.54  In the analysis, the AUVSI determined that 92 percent 
of the waivers were issued to entities with fewer than 100 employees.  Based on this data, the FAA 
determined that a majority of entities operating unmanned aircraft for other than recreational purposes are 
small.55  Accordingly, based on the FAA’s determination, we conclude that a majority of UAS operators 
are small entities.      
D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements
18. The NPRM proposes to adopt a band plan and service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band 
to enable small and other UAS operators, to access interference-protected spectrum for control-and-non-
payload communications (CNPC) links, and seeks comment on various options.  We expect the proposals 
and service rules upon which we seek comment in the NPRM will impose new or additional reporting or 
recordkeeping and/or other compliance obligations on small and other UA operators for access and use of 
the 5030-5091 MHz band spectrum.  At this time however, the Commission cannot quantify the cost of 
compliance and cannot determine whether small entities will have to hire professionals to comply with 
the rule changes that may be adopted in this proceeding.  With our request for comments on the band plan 
and service rules, we have also requested that parties file costs analyses to assist with the Commission’s 
assessment of the rules that are under consideration.  Below we discuss proposals in the NPRM and their 
potential compliance requirements for small and other entities to operate in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  
19.The Band Plan.  The NPRM proposes to partition the 5030-5091 MHz band to 
accommodate both non-networked radio-line-of-sight — or Non-Networked Access (NNA) — use cases, 
which can rely on direct communication links between an operator’s controller and the unmanned aircraft 
(UA), and beyond-radio-line-of-sight — or Network-Supported Service (NSS) — use cases, which 
typically depend on network infrastructure to support communications between the operator and the UA.  
The NPRM proposes to dedicate a minimum of 10 megahertz of spectrum for NNA operations, and seeks 
comment on various options for the remaining 51 megahertz of spectrum, including dedicating 40 
megahertz of spectrum for network-based NSS operations by dividing the spectrum into 4 licensed blocks 
of 10 megahertz each, and providing 11 megahertz for temporary additional spectrum available to either 
NNA-based operators or NSS licensees.  The NPRM further proposes to permit only CNPC in the band, 
to define CNPC as any UAS transmission that is sent to or from the UA component of the UAS and that 
supports the safety or regularity of the UA’s flight.  It further proposes to provide that any entity, other 
than those precluded by section 310 of the Communications Act, will be eligible to obtain a 5030-5091 
MHz NNA station or obtain a 5030-5091 MHz NSS license, and seeks comment on similarly restricting 
the eligibility of entities to operate NNA stations using assignments from a DFMS.   
20.Dynamic Frequency Management System.  The NPRM proposes that access to the band 
be managed by one or more dynamic frequency management systems (DFMSs).  A DFMS would be a 
frequency coordination system that, in response to requests from registered NNA users, would determine 
and assign to the requesting user, through an automated (non-manual) process, temporary use of certain 
frequencies for a particular geographic area and time period tailored to the user’s submitted flight plan.  
The NPRM seeks comment on the appropriate regulatory framework to establish for a DFMS, including 
what requirements should be imposed on UAS operators in the band to help ensure a DFMS’s ability to 
provide interference-free access.  Among other possible requirements, the NPRM seeks comment on what 
information the operator should be required to provide regarding ground stations and unmanned aircraft 
stations, including whether an active UAS in the band should be required to submit information required 
by FAA’s Remote ID rule, or some subset or variation of the information, and whether a UAS should be 
54 See Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, Remote Identification of Unmanned Aircraft, 
86 Fed. Reg. 4390, 4494 (Jan. 15, 2021) (Remote ID Rule).
55 See id.
556Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
required to communicate to the DFMS, in real time or within a certain period of time of the relevant 
event, the initiation and termination of the flight or, alternatively, the initiation and termination of the 
operator’s use of the assigned frequencies.  Both of these potential rules would likely have reporting 
implications for small and other UAS operators, if adopted.  The NPRM also seeks comment on whether 
to require UAS operators to register with a DFMS as a pre-condition of receiving NNA assignments and 
to provide certain information with such registration, which could also impact recordkeeping and 
reporting obligations.  The NPRM proposes to authorize the administrator of a DFMS to charge UAS 
operators reasonable fees for its provision of services, including registration and channel assignment 
services, and to permit parties to petition the Commission to review fees and require changes if they are 
found to be excessive.      
21.NNA Service Rules.  The NPRM proposes to adopt service rules for NNA operations, 
including rules for licensing and technical requirements, and seeks comment broadly on the licensing 
regime or mechanism to enable authorization of NNA operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and the 
costs and benefits of any proposed approach.  For the licensing of stations in NNA spectrum, the NPRM 
proposes to adopt a licensed-by-rule authorization for aircraft and ground stations in the band.  For 
technical requirements, the NPRM proposes to adopt the technical standard RTCA DO-362A or technical 
requirements based on this standard, which contains Minimum Operational Performance Standards for 
terrestrial-based (i.e., non-satellite) CNPC point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links in the 5030-5091 
MHz band, including power limits, emission limits, and frequency accuracy requirements.  In both the 
licensing eligibility and technical standards requirement discussions, we inquire whether to impose 
certification requirements that would likely be filed with the Commission, thereby impacting reporting 
requirements for users of the 5030-5091 MHz band.  
22. We also seek comment on whether any of the general technical requirements in subpart D 
of part 87 of the Commission’s rules should apply to NNA equipment, and whether to adopt any other 
requirements on NNA equipment to facilitate a DFMS’s ability to communicate with or otherwise control 
such equipment in the execution of the DFMS’s responsibilities.  In addition, the NPRM seeks comment 
on the potential application of the generally applicable rules in subparts B through F of part 87, including 
whether to require each UAS operator using an NNA assignment in the 5030-5091 MHz band to have an 
operator license or permit.  It further seeks comment on whether the new service should be subject to 
rules under part 1, subpart F governing “Wireless Radio Service” applications and proceedings.  The 
application and/or incorporation of existing rules under part 87 or any other part of the Commission’s 
rules would subject NNA users of the 5030-5091 MHz band to any applicable reporting and 
recordkeeping requirements under those rules unless explicitly excluded in the final rules.
23.NSS Service Rules.  The NPRM also seeks comment on service rules for NSS licenses, 
including rules addressing, in particular, whether to issue geographic area defined licenses for a specific 
term of years, with rights of renewal.  More specifically, the NPRM seeks comment on rules addressing 
(1) the geographic area scheme for licenses, (2) the appropriate initial and subsequent license terms, (3) 
performance requirements, (4) license renewal framework, and (5) technical and operational 
requirements.
24. For the geographic area of licenses, the NPRM seeks comment on whether to adopt larger 
licenses areas such as Regional Economic Area Groupings, a more granular scheme such as Partial 
Economic Areas, or a geographic division of the country developed specifically for aviation purposes.  
The NPRM proposes to issue NSS licenses for an initial 15-year term, and to limit subsequent terms to 10 
years.  The NPRM seeks comment on the appropriate standard for license renewal, and on whether the 
regulatory renewal framework for commercial geographic licensees of wireless radio services under part 
1 of the Commission’s rules is appropriate for NSS licensees.  The NPRM also seeks comment on 
performance requirements, such as a requirement to cover 80 percent of the population within 12 years of 
license grant, and 45 percent coverage of the population within six years of license grant.  For compliance 
demonstration, the NPRM proposes to adopt a process similar to compliance rules applicable to part 27 
licensees, requiring licensees to file a construction notification with the Commission within 15 days of the 
expiration of the applicable benchmark, including submission of electronic coverage maps accurately 
557Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
depicting the boundaries of the licensed area and the boundaries of the actual areas to which the licensee 
provides service.  For enforcement, the NPRM proposes that if a licensee fails to meet the final 
performance requirement, the license authorization will terminate automatically without specific 
Commission action, and that failure to meet the interim requirement would result in the reduction by two 
years of both the due date for the final performance requirement and the license term.
25. In the event that the Commission receives mutually exclusive license applications for 
NSS licenses, the NPRM proposes to assign these exclusive use licenses through a system of competitive 
bidding.  Consistent with the competitive bidding procedures the Commission has used in previous 
auctions, the NPRM proposes to conduct any auction for geographic area licenses for spectrum in the 
band in conformity with the part 1, subpart Q general competitive bidding rules, subject to any 
modification of the part 1 rules that the Commission may adopt in the future.  For small entities, the 
NPRM seeks comment on whether to make bidding credits available for eligible small businesses and 
rural service providers.  
26. The NPRM also seeks comment on appropriate technical requirements for NSS licenses, 
and whether the technical standard RTCA DO-362A or equivalent technical parameters should also apply 
to NSS licenses.  As an alternative to requiring NSS licensee compliance with the RTCA DO-362A 
standard generally, the NPRM also seeks comment on whether there are certain specific requirements of 
RTCA DO-362A that the Commission should minimally impose on NSS licensees to ensure compatibility 
with NNA operations, or for other purposes, such as the Time Division Duplex requirements of the 
RTCA DO-362A standard.  In addition, the NPRM seeks comment on adoption of a field strength limit to 
prevent interference between adjacent geographic area licensees.
27. As with NNA service rules, the NPRM seeks comment on whether and to what extent the 
NSS service rules should incorporate or be subject to the requirements generally applicable to aviation 
services under subparts B through F of part 87 of the Commission’s rules, either in their current form or 
with modifications, and whether the NSS service should be subject to rules under part 1, subpart F 
governing wireless radio service applications and proceedings.  In particular, the NPRM seeks comment 
on whether to allow partitioning and disaggregation of NSS licenses as well as spectrum leasing.  
Likewise as mentioned earlier in the NNA service rules discussion, NSS users would be subject to any 
applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements under existing Commission’s rules incorporated into 
the requirements for the 5030-5091 MHz band.  The NPRM also seeks comment on whether to authorize 
NSS licensees, at their discretion, to provide network-supported service for UAS CNPC through either a 
satellite or terrestrial network, or alternatively, whether the Commission should provide that certain NSS 
licenses are dedicated exclusively to satellite-based service.  It further seeks comment on whether to 
permit NSS licensees to deploy High-altitude Platform Stations (HAPS).    
28.Equipment Authorization.  To ensure that equipment in the new band has the level of 
reliability and safety required of aviation equipment, the NPRM proposes to impose equipment 
authorization requirements similar to those under sections 87.145 and 87.147 of the Commission’s rules 
to all equipment intended for use in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  Section 87.145 requires that each 
transmitter must be certificated for use in the relevant service, and section 87.147 establishes a specific 
equipment authorization process.  Section 87.147 specifically requires an applicant for certification of 
equipment to notify the FAA of the filing of the application, and provides that the Commission will not 
act on the application until it receives the FAA’s determination regarding whether it objects to the 
application for equipment authorization.
29.Protection of Other Services.  The NPRM seeks comment on any measures the 
Commission should adopt to protect federal Microwave Landing System (MLS) deployments in the 5030-
5091 MHz band, and on whether to provide that no future non-federal MLS licenses (including MLS 
radionavigation land test licenses at 5031 MHz) will be granted in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  To protect 
radio astronomy operations, the NPRM proposes, consistent with NTIA’s recommendations, to continue 
to apply to the 5030-5091 MHz band the requirements of Footnote US211 of the Table of Frequency 
Allocations, and to prohibit UAS operations within the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) without prior 
558Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
coordination with the NRQZ administrator and submission of a concurrence from the NRQZ 
administrator with any request to a DFMS for frequency assignment within the NRQZ.  The NPRM also 
seeks comment on applying to all UAS operations relying on the 5030-5091 MHz band in the NRQZ the 
licensee/applicant procedures for the NRQZ under section 1.924(a) of the Commission’s rules, which 
include written notification filing requirements.56  The NPRM further seeks comment on any special 
measures necessary to ensure compatibility between UAS operations in the 5030-5091 MHz band and 
AeroMACS and flight testing in adjacent bands.  To protect radionavigation-satellite service in the 5010-
5030 MHz band, the NPRM proposes to require 5030-5091 MHz operations to comply with the specific 
effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) spectral density limit specified in Footnote 5.443C of the 
Table of Frequency Allocations.  With regard to Canadian and Mexican coordination, the NPRM proposes 
to provide that all operations in the band are subject to international agreements with Mexico and Canada.
30.Airborne Use of Flexible-Use Spectrum.  Regarding UAS operations in flexible-use 
spectrum, the Commission did not make specific proposals and seeks comment on the adequacy of its 
current rules to ensure co-existence of existing terrestrial wireless networks and UAS, and on the 
regulatory solutions that may be necessary to facilitate and encourage such use.  Thus, at this time the 
Commission is not in a position to determine what rule changes could result from the questions raised in 
the NPRM, and which of those changes, if any, will result in reporting and/or recordkeeping obligations 
for small entities.  
31.VHF Licenses for UAS Pilots.  The NPRM proposes that the Commission individually 
license stations for UA pilot communication with control towers and other aircraft pilots under a new 
category of licensed station, an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Ground VHF Station, and to define the new 
station as “a station on the ground providing unmanned aircraft pilot radio communication relating to 
safety and regularity of flight on air traffic control, flight service station,  unicom, or multicom 
frequencies.”  The NPRM further proposes to provide that these stations may operate over all air traffic 
control, flight service station, aeronautical advisory station (unicom) and aeronautical multicom channels 
authorized for use by aircraft.  In addition, the NPRM proposes to permit mobile stations (stations 
intended to be used while in motion or during halts at unspecified points), and seeks comment on whether 
to permit non-mobile stations as well.  Under this proposal, UAS operators would be required to file a 
license application with the Commission for an individual license covering their VHF station.        
E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
32. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, 
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following 
four alternatives (among others): “(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements 
or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, 
consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for such small 
entities; (3) the use of performance, rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of 
the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.”57
33. In this proceeding, the Commission seeks comment on options to license the 5030-5091 
MHz band for UAS CNPC.  UAS operators have a growing need for the greater reliability of interference-
protected licensed spectrum for CNPC, and the licensing of the 5030-5091 MHz band has the potential to 
provide UAS operators with access to interference-protected communications of sufficient reliability for 
operations where those communications links are safety-critical.  As such access will support the growth 
of the UAS industry and help to realize its enormous potential economic and social benefits, the 
Commission anticipates that adoption of licensing rules for the band will have a significant positive 
economic impact on small and other UAS manufacturers, operators, and other stakeholders.  
56 See 47 CFR § 1.924.
57 See 5 U.S.C. § 603(c)(1)-(4). 
559Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
34. The Commission believes that applying the licensing rules equally to all entities will 
generally be necessary to protect the safety of life and property in air navigation and promote the efficient 
and intensive use of spectrum.  However, to assist the Commission’s evaluation of the economic impact 
on small entities and to better explore the alternatives in consideration of their economic impact on small 
entities as well as other factors, the NPRM has sought comment broadly on possible alternatives for a 
band plan and licensing rules, and requests information on the potential costs and benefits of such 
alternatives to small and other UAS operators.  In addition, the NPRM has proposed or sought comment 
on certain specific options that may facilitate small entity access to spectrum in the band.  
35. The NPRM proposes a band plan to support both NNA and NSS operations.  We propose 
to partition the band, to dedicate different segments of spectrum in the 5030-5091 MHz band for NNA 
and NSS, and to license each of these segments in a manner that is appropriate to support the relevant use 
cases in order to accommodate both NNA and NSS users.  We are also considering whether to make 
available spectrum for multi-purpose uses, e.g., expansion bands for temporary NNA or NSS use, and 
seek comment on this alternative.  We seek comment on whether we should use a portion of the 51 
megahertz for opportunistic use by both NNA or NSS licensees (multi-purpose use) or whether we should 
increase the amount of spectrum dedicated to NNA operations.  
36. To the extent we dedicate spectrum for NSS licenses, we also seek comment on making 
that spectrum available for NNA operations on an interim, opportunistic basis.  We seek comment on the 
costs and benefits of this approach, including its technical and economic feasibility, and on alternative 
approaches to ensuring productive usage of dedicated NSS spectrum prior to network deployment, which 
will help inform the Commission on the impact for small entities before adopting final rules.  Further, as 
alternative approach to allocating spectrum in the band, we seek comment on alternative approaches to 
allocating the 5030-5091 MHz band for the support of UAS, including whether we should (1) allocate 
only a portion of the band at this time and defer allocation of the remainder of the band or (2) preserve 
part of the band at this time for experimental use, or for potential future satellite-based CNPC that relies 
on the AMS(R)S allocation in the band.
37. Ensuring the ability of the DFMS to provide interference-free access and promote robust 
and efficient use of the spectrum will most likely require the adoption of rules for NNA operators, 
including small operators.  We seek comment on such requirements, including: (1) whether to require 
operators to provide ground station geographic location, effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP), 
and/or antenna patterns; (2) whether to require an active UAS relying on an NNA assignment in the band 
to provide a DFMS with the UA information that must be broadcast under the Remote ID rule or some 
subset or variation of the information; (3) whether a UAS operator should be required to affirmatively 
communicate to the DFMS, in real time or within a certain period of time of the relevant event, the 
initiation and termination of the flight or, alternatively, the initiation and termination of the operator’s use 
of the assigned frequencies; and (4) whether there are other circumstances or information (aside from the 
request) that a UAS operator should be required by rule to communicate to the DFMS.
38. Interactions between the DFMS and UAS operators involving frequency assignment may 
require the Commission to adopt a registration process.  Rather than propose a mandatory registration 
requirement before frequency assignments can be requested, we seek comment from small and other UAS 
operators on whether such a requirement is needed, and if so, what requirements should be imposed 
regarding registration.  We seek comment on whether the Commission should simply require registration 
and leave the details to be developed such as by the DFMSs or a multi-stakeholder group.  We believe 
that allowing small UAS operators and other commenters to address this issue, including with cost data 
analysis, is the better approach to inform the Commission on the economic and other impacts for these 
operators.  Similarly, regarding the submission of frequency requests, we consider what requirements, if 
any, should be imposed with respect to the submission of UAS operator requests for NNA frequency 
assignments, and alternatively what, if any, details of the request process should be left to be developed 
by a multi-stakeholder group.  We also consider in the NPRM how to assist small and other operators if 
the need to revise their assignments arises after a flight has commenced by seeking comment on what, if 
560Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
any rules we should adopt to enable or facilitate the filing and timely processing of requests by the DFMS 
for revised assignments, or to otherwise address an operator’s mid-flight need for revised assignment.
39. As part of the DFMS frequency coordination system, we have proposed and seek 
comment on allowing the DFMS administrator to charge reasonable fees for its provision of services, 
including registration and frequency assignment services, to UAS operators receiving the services.  The 
Commission has taken steps to minimize the economic impact on small and other UAS operators by 
proposing to authorize UAS operators to petition the Commission to review DFMS fees and require 
changes if they are found to be unreasonable or excessive.  Additionally, to encourage efficient use of the 
limited spectrum resource and discourage any attempt at warehousing which would likely disadvantage 
small UAS operators, we seek comment on specifically authorizing reasonable usage-based fees.  
40. We also seek comment on potential alternatives to the DFMS proposal to enable dynamic 
spectrum access to the 5030-5091 MHz band, on the feasibility, costs, and benefits of alternative options 
as compared to the DFMS, and on whether such alternatives would be sufficiently reliable to support even 
the most safety-critical uses such as flights in controlled airspace.
41. The NPRM also proposes to implement licensing of NNA stations using licensed-by-rule 
authorization for both aircraft and ground stations in the band.  Licensing by rule would reduce the burden 
on small entities and other UAS operators of obtaining direct access to protected spectrum for CNPC, as 
they would not be required to obtain individual spectrum licenses for themselves or their aircraft or 
ground UAS stations in order to operate in the 5030-5091 MHz band.  In addressing the license rules for 
NSS operations, the NPRM seeks comment on issuing licenses on an exclusive geographic area basis.  
The NPRM also seeks comment on several options that may help to reduce the burden to small entities of 
obtaining and using such licenses or otherwise facilitate small entity access to this spectrum.  First, while 
the NPRM seeks comment on defining license areas using large geographic areas such as Regional 
Economic Area Groupings (REAGs) (which divide the nation into twelve regional areas), it also seeks 
comment on using a more granular scheme, such as Partial Economic Areas (PEA), which may be more 
affordable or better tailored for small entities.  
42. Second, the NPRM proposes certain measures to facilitate small entity participation in 
any competitive bidding process conducted for these licenses.  Specifically, the NPRM proposes to 
conduct a competitive bidding process in the event that it receives mutually exclusive license 
applications.  In order to promote and reduce the costs of participation for small service providers, the 
NPRM proposes to make bidding credits available for this band.  A bidding credit of 15 percent for a 
qualifying “small business,” defined as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five years 
not exceeding $55 million, and a bidding credit of a 25 percent for a qualifying “very small business,” 
defined as an entity with average gross revenues for the preceding five years not exceeding $20 million 
have been proposed in the NPRM.58  These proposed small business definitions and bidding credits are 
consistent with recent competitive bidding processes used by the Commission for assignment of licenses.  
The NPRM also seeks comment on whether to offer rural service providers a bidding credit for licenses in 
this band which would provide another opportunity for small providers who would qualify as rural 
providers to reduce their the costs of participation.
58 The standardized schedule of bidding credits provided in section 1.2110(f)(2)(i) of the rules defines small 
businesses based on average gross revenues for the preceding three years.  In December 2018, Congress revised the 
standard set out in the Small Business Act for categorizing a business concern as a “small business concern,” by 
changing the annual average gross receipts benchmark from a three-year period to a five-year period.  Thus, as a 
general matter, a federal agency cannot propose to categorize a business concern as a “small business concern” for 
Small Business Act purposes unless the size of the concern is based on its annual average gross receipts “over a 
period of not less than 5 years.”  15 U.S.C. § 632(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II), as amended by Small Business Runway Extension 
Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-324 (Dec. 17, 2018); see 13 CFR § 121.903(a)(1)(ii).  For consistency with the statutory 
requirements, we therefore propose to adopt the Small Business Act’s revised five-year average gross receipts 
benchmark for purposes of determining which entities qualify for small business bidding credits.
561Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-101
43. Third, the NPRM seeks comment on whether to allow partitioning and disaggregation of 
NSS licenses in secondary market transactions as well as spectrum leasing.  Allowing these secondary 
market transactions could provide small entities with additional options for access to this spectrum, and 
may be an effective way to facilitate targeted network deployments, including by small entities.    
44. In the NPRM, the Commission seeks comment on UAS operations on flexible-use 
spectrum using existing networks as platforms, which may offer small and other UAS operators a near 
term, low-cost option rather than requiring them to build-out a dedicated network for UAS operations.  
However, because existing terrestrial networks were not designed for UAS use, the Commission’s 
terrestrial mobile service rules generally do not consider airborne use, and the introduction of UAS 
operations may result in increased interference.  In light of the considerable stakeholder interest in UAS 
on flexible-use spectrum, and the Commission’s commitment to allow flexibility in the use of existing 
spectrum and networks to the extent feasible, the Commission explores flexible-use as a potential option 
for UAS operations and seeks comment on the adequacy of its current rules to ensure co-existence of 
existing terrestrial wireless networks and UAS as well as on the regulatory solutions that may be 
necessary to facilitate and encourage such use.  The Commission expects to more fully understand the 
feasibility of allowing UAS operations on flexible-use spectrum and the economic impact on small 
entities following its review of comments filed in response to the NPRM. 
45. We also discuss adding a provision to part 87 of the Commission’s rules to enable UAS 
operators to file an application with the Commission to obtain an individual VHF license under a new 
category of licensed station to address a need by some small and other UAS operators to communicate 
with ATC facilities in accordance with FAA rules.  As mentioned in the prior section, in some instances 
the FAA requires UAS operators to communicate with ATC or with nearby manned aircraft over the VHF 
traffic control and advisory frequencies and to obtain a license from the Commission for this purpose.  In 
the absence of provisions in the Commission’s rules to provide such a license, the Commission handles 
such requests from UAS operators by granting special temporary authority on a case-by-case basis.  The 
addition of the proposed licensing provision to part 87 will provide certainty of process and a more 
permanent operating authorization for small entities as compared to the special temporary authority the 
Commission uses for UAS operators to comply with the FAA’s requirements.  We anticipate that this 
proposal will help to facilitate the growth and safety of UAS operations by small and other entities.  
46. Finally, the Commission expects to consider more fully the economic impact on small 
entities following its review of comments filed in response to the NPRM, including costs and benefits 
information and alternative proposals.  The Commission’s evaluation of the comments filed in this 
proceeding will shape the final alternatives it considers, the final conclusions it reaches, and the actions it 
ultimately takes in this proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small 
entities as a result of any final rules that are adopted.
F. Federal Rules that May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict with the Proposed Rules
47. Proposed UAS service rules for the 5030-5091 MHz band would, in part, overlap with 
and, depending on the UAS equipment requirements established in this proceeding, may be inconsistent 
with the FAA’s Technical Standard Order (TSO) C213a, which establishes minimum performance 
standards for UAS radios in the 5030-5091 MHz band.

STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS
Re: Spectrum Rules and Policies for the Operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems; Petition of AIA for 
Rulemaking to Adopt Service Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Command and Control in the 
5030-5091 MHz Band, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WT Docket No. 22-323, RM-11798 
(terminated)
I’m pleased to see us move toward unleashing more spectrum for unmanned aircraft systems 
(UAS).
As I’ve said before, this is an area where the United States can clearly lead with the right 
regulatory support.  U.S. companies and research universities continue to incubate drone technologies at 
FAA-designated testing sites across the country—including in Nevada, where I previously visited a 
testbed to learn about the industry’s vision and growing challenges.  In 2021, we helped drive drone 
development through the establishment of FCC “Innovation Zones.”  We followed it up by refreshing the 
record on a path forward for drones in the 5030-5091 MHz band—which is the focus of our action today.  
As I said back then, “these systems cannot truly flourish without Commission action governing the 
operation of UAS in licensed spectrum,” and getting there “will require careful work with our federal 
partners.”  Today, after close collaboration with NTIA and the FAA, we’re proposing service and 
licensing rules to support robust, reliable, and safe UAS deployments in the 5 GHz band.  That’s real 
progress.
Of course, even as far as the Commission’s role is concerned, securing a vibrant future for UAS 
isn’t about just one frequency band.  That’s why I’m pleased to see us incorporate other critical issues 
related to drone operations into this notice of proposed rulemaking.  Consistent with industry and 
academic interest and ongoing standards-setting efforts, we’re exploring 5G as a UAS platform and the 
broader use of cellular bands for drone applications.  We’re also proposing a way to license drone 
communications with air traffic control. 
UAS technologies pose plenty of potential, and their promise goes well beyond just package 
deliveries.  They can aid disaster relief, protect critical infrastructure, enhance smart applications and 
precision agriculture, improve public safety, and even help us build more safely and efficiently.  We’re 
right to continue supporting their development, even as we also explore the unique policy challenges 
posed by their operation.
I am grateful to the Commission staff who developed this item.  It has my full support.

I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Commission first adopted a rule in 2007 requiring telecommunications carriers and 
interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers to notify customers and federal law 
enforcement of breaches of customer proprietary network information (CPNI) in the carriers’ possession.1  
In the almost decade and a half since that time, data breaches nationwide have increased in both 
frequency and severity in all industries.2  In the telecommunications industry, the public has suffered an

increasing number of security breaches of customer information in recent years.3  Federal and state data 
breach laws covering other areas have evolved since 2007.4  Those developments combined with our 
specific experience suggest opportunities for improvement in our own breach notification rule.  The time 
is ripe.  Today, we begin the process to update and strengthen our data breach rule to provide greater 
protections to the public.  
II. BACKGROUND
2. Privacy of Telecommunications Customer Information.  Section 222 of the 
Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), requires telecommunications carriers to protect the 
privacy and security of information about their customers to which they have access as a result of their 
unique position as network operators.5  Section 222(a) requires carriers to protect the confidentiality of 
proprietary information of and relating to their customers.6  Section 222(c)(1) provides that a carrier may 
only use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI that it has received by virtue of its provision of a 
telecommunications service: (1) as required by law; (2) with the customer’s approval; or (3) in its 
provision of the telecommunications service from which such information is derived, or services 
necessary to or used in the provision of such telecommunications service.7  The Act defines CPNI as “(A)

5 47 U.S.C. § 222.  See also Implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Telecommunications Carriers’ 
Use of Customer Proprietary Network Information and Other Customer Information, et al., CC Docket Nos. 96-115, 
et al., Order on Reconsideration and Petitions for Forbearance, 14 FCC Rcd 14409, 14419-20, paras. 12-14 (1999) 
(1999 CPNI Reconsideration Order) (denying petitions for reconsideration and forbearance seeking different 
treatment for wireless providers under the Commission’s CPNI rules, concluding that “there is nothing in the statute 
or its legislative history to indicate that Congress intended the CPNI requirements in section 222 should not apply to 
wireless carriers”).
6 47 U.S.C. § 222(a).  
7 47 U.S.C. § 222(c)(1).  Section 222(b) provides that a carrier that receives or obtains proprietary 
information from other carriers in order to provide a telecommunications service may only use such 
information for that purpose and may not use that information for its own marketing efforts.  47 U.S.C. § 
222(b).  Section 222(d) delineates certain exceptions to the general principle of confidentiality, including 
permitting a carrier to use, disclose, or permit access to CPNI obtained from its customers to protect 
telecommunications services users “from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to” 
telecommunications services.  47 U.S.C. § 222(d).  Subsequent to the adoption of section 222(c)(1), 
Congress added section 222(f).  Section 222(f) provides that for purposes of section 222(c)(1), without

information that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, location, and amount of 
use of a telecommunications service subscribed to by any customer of a telecommunications carrier, and 
that is made available to the carrier by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship; 
and (B) information contained in the bills pertaining to telephone exchange service or telephone toll 
service received by a customer of a carrier.”8  The Commission has explained that CPNI includes (but is 
not limited to) information such as the phone numbers called by a consumer; the frequency, duration, and 
timing of such calls; the location of a mobile device when it is in active mode (i.e., able to signal its 
location to nearby network facilities); and any services purchased by the consumer, such as call waiting.9
3. The Commission first promulgated rules implementing section 222 in 1998.10  In addition 
to adopting restrictions on the use and disclosure of CPNI, the Commission adopted a set of rules 
designed to ensure that telecommunications carriers establish effective safeguards to protect against 
unauthorized use or disclosure of CPNI.11  In 2007, the Commission amended its CPNI rules to, among 
other things, require carriers12 to notify law enforcement and customers of security breaches involving 
CPNI.13  The Commission defined “breach” for this purpose as one that occurs “when a person, without 
authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.”14  
The Commission’s rules require a telecommunications carrier to notify law enforcement of a breach of its 
customers’ CPNI no later than seven business days after a reasonable determination of a breach by 
sending electronic notification through a central reporting facility to the United States Secret Service 
(Secret Service) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).15  The rules permit a telecommunications 
(Continued from previous page)  
the “express prior authorization” of the customer, a customer shall not be considered to have approved the 
use or disclosure of or access to (1) call location information concerning the user of a commercial mobile 
service or (2) automatic crash notification information of any person other than for use in the operation of 
an automatic crash notification system.  47 U.S.C. § 222(f).

11 See id.  at 8195, para. 193.  
12 In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we refer to telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP 
providers collectively as “telecommunications carriers” or “carriers,” consistent with our existing Part 64, Subpart U 
rules.  In doing so, we do not address the regulatory classification of interconnected VoIP service or interconnected 
VoIP service providers.  See 47 CFR § 64.2003(o) (defining telecommunications carrier or carrier for purposes of 
Subpart U to include an entity that provides interconnected VoIP service as that term is defined in 47 CFR § 9.3).
13 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943-45, paras. 26-32.
14 47 CFR § 64.2011(e).
15 47 CFR § 64.2011(b).  Additionally, the Commission’s rules require carriers to maintain a record of any 
discovered breaches, notifications to the Secret Service and the FBI regarding those breaches, as well as the Secret 
Service and the FBI response to the notifications for a period of at least two years.  This record must include, if 
available, the date that the carrier discovered the breach, the date that the carrier notified the Secret Service and the

carrier to notify the customer and/or disclose the breach publicly after seven business days following 
notification to the Secret Service and the FBI, if the Secret Service and the FBI have not requested that 
the telecommunications carrier continue to postpone disclosure.16  Under the rules, a telecommunications 
carrier may immediately notify a customer or disclose the breach publicly only after consultation with the 
relevant investigative agency and only if the carrier believes that there is an extraordinarily urgent need to 
notify a customer or class of customers in order to avoid immediate and irreparable harm.17  The 
Commission declined to specify the precise content of the notice that must be provided to customers in 
the event of a breach of CPNI, saying that it was leaving telecommunications carriers discretion to tailor 
the language and method of notification to the circumstances.18
4. In 2016, the Commission acted to revise its breach notification rule as part of a larger 
proceeding addressing privacy requirements for broadband internet access service providers (ISPs).19  In 
2017, however, Congress nullified those 2016 revisions to the Commission’s CPNI rules under the 
Congressional Review Act.20  
5. In 2013, as part of a larger proceeding addressing the video relay service (VRS) and 
telecommunications relay (TRS) programs, the Commission adopted rules to protect the privacy of 
(Continued from previous page)  
FBI, a detailed description of the CPNI that was breached, and the circumstances of the breach.  See 47 CFR § 
64.2011(d).
16 If the relevant investigating agency determines that public disclosure or notice to customers would impede or 
compromise an ongoing or potential criminal investigation or national security, the law enforcement agency may 
direct the carrier not to disclose the breach for an initial 30-day period.  This 30-day period may be extended by the 
law enforcement agency as reasonably necessary in the judgment of the agency.  The law enforcement agency shall 
provide in writing to the carrier its initial direction to the carrier and any subsequent direction.  47 CFR § 
64.2011(b)(3).
17 See 47 CFR § 64.2011(b)(2) (requiring a telecommunications carrier to indicate its desire to notify its customer or 
class of customers immediately in the notice that it provides to the Secret Service and FBI).

Commission classified broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to Title II of the

customer information relating to all relay services authorized under section 225 of the Act.21  In that 
proceeding, the Commission adopted a data breach reporting rule applicable to TRS modeled off of the 
CPNI data breach reporting rule applicable to telecommunications services. 22  
6. Data Breach Notification Laws and Regulations.  As the Commission has previously 
explained, its data breach rule is “not intend[ed] to supersede any statute, regulation, order, or 
interpretation in any state, except to the extent that such statute regulation, order, or interpretation is 
inconsistent with the provisions” of the rule, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.23  In 2007, 
the Commission explicitly rejected requests to preempt all state CPNI obligations, finding instead that 
states should also be allowed to create rules for protecting CPNI.24
7. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have 
laws requiring covered entities to notify individuals of data breaches.25  Our breach notification 
requirement is one of several sector-specific breach notification laws in the United States.  The Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), and the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC)-enforced Health Breach Notification Rule all have customer 
notification requirements for breaches of individual data.26  In addition to sector-specific breach 
notification rules, the FTC has brought actions under section 5(a) of the FTC Act raising allegations that 
companies acted unfairly by failing to protect consumer data, resulting in security breaches.27  The FTC 
has also published extensive guidance for businesses in the event of a security breach of customer 
information, setting forth recommendations for appropriate best practices after a data breach has

occurred.28
8. Recent Developments.  The Commission adopted the data breach rule, like the rest of the 
privacy safeguards adopted in the 2007 CPNI Order , to address the problem of “pretexting,” the practice 
of pretending to be a particular customer or other authorized person in order to obtain access to that 
customer’s call detail or other private communications records.29  In the almost 15 years since, it has 
become clear that breaches of customer information in many contexts extend far beyond pretexting in 
general or the specific type of pretexting addressed at that time and are increasing in scale and evolving in 
methodology.  For example in 2015, AT&T reached a settlement with the Commission to resolve an 
investigation into three data breaches at call centers in Mexico, Columbia, and the Philippines perpetrated 
by insiders who sold customer information to criminals that resulted in the compromise of the personal 
information of almost 52,000 customers.30  In 2017, Verizon confirmed the leak of the personal data of 
six million customers, caused by a misconfigured security configuration on a cloud server.31  And in 
2021, T-Mobile disclosed that the personal information of over 50 million customers was stolen by 
hackers.32  Verizon also recently disclosed a breach of its subsidiary Visible.33  And Syniverse, which 
provides interconnection services to wireless carriers, disclosed that that an unknown “individual or 
organization gained unauthorized access to databases within its network on several occasions,” potentially 
compromising the security of text messages of millions of wireless customers in a series of breaches 
spanning years.34  These examples demonstrate the increasing severity and diversifying methods of 
security breaches involving customer information, which can have lasting detrimental impacts on 
customers whose information has been breached.35
9. To help protect consumers from the ever-growing harms of breaches of personal 
information across sectors, Congress and the states have taken action.  For example, in 2009, Congress 
enacted laws that created breach notification requirements for businesses that maintain health care 
information, resulting in HIPAA’s breach notification rules and the FTC’s Health Breach Notification

Rule.36  In 2010, Congress passed laws imposing breach notification requirements on financial institutions 
through amendments to GLBA.37  At the state level, California has been an active leader in consumer 
privacy laws,38 most recently in 2019 with the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)39 and the 
passage of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) in 2020.40  Elsewhere, in 2021, Virginia and 
Colorado became the second and third states respectively to enact comprehensive consumer privacy 
laws,41 while every state and territory now has some form of breach notification requirements.42   Both 
California’s and Virginia’s recent privacy laws drew inspiration from the 2016 passage of the European 
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which created one of the world’s most 
comprehensive privacy regimes.43
III. DISCUSSION
10. To better protect telecommunications customers and ensure that our rules keep pace with 
today’s challenges, we propose a number of updates to our rule addressing telecommunications carriers’ 
breach notification duties.  We seek to ensure that affected customers, the Commission, and other federal 
law enforcement agencies receive the information they need in a timely manner so they can mitigate and 
prevent harm due to the breach and take action to deter future breaches.44  To identify best practices and 
to minimize burdens, we look to other federal and state breach laws as potential models for our rules.
11. We propose to expand the Commission’s definition of “breach” to include inadvertent 
disclosures of customer information and seek comment on adopting a harm-based trigger for breach 
notifications.  We also propose to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret 
Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach.  We also propose to eliminate the

action against the perpetrators, thus ensuring that they do not continue to breach CPNI . . . [and] this should enable 
law enforcement to advise industry, the Commission, and perhaps Congress regarding additional measures that 
might prevent future breaches.”).

mandatory waiting period before notifying customers and instead require carriers to notify customers of 
CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless requested by law 
enforcement.  We also seek comment on whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content 
of customer breach notices.  We also evaluate and seek comment on the impact of the Congressional 
disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order on the Commission’s legal authority to issue the rules proposed 
herein for telecommunications carriers.  Finally, we propose to make changes to our TRS data breach 
reporting rule consistent with those we propose to our CPNI breach reporting rule.
A. Defining “Breach”
12. Inadvertent Disclosures.  We propose to expand the Commission’s definition of “breach” 
to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosures of customer information and seek comment on our 
proposal.  Our current rule, adopted in response to the practice of pretexting,45 defines a “breach” as 
“when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, 
used, or disclosed CPNI.”46  While the practice of pretexting necessarily involves an intent to gain access 
to customer information, the intervening years since the adoption of our existing rule have demonstrated 
that the inadvertent exposure of customer information can result in the loss and misuse of sensitive 
information by scammers and phishers, and trigger a need to inform the affected individuals so that they 
can take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their information.47  Further, whether or not a breach 
was intentional may not always be immediately apparent, which may lead to legal ambiguity and under-
reporting.  We also believe that it is important that the Commission and law enforcement be made aware 
of any accidental access, use, or disclosures so that we can (1) investigate and advise carriers on how best 
to avoid future breaches, and (2) stand ready to investigate if and when any of the affected information 
falls prey to malicious actors.48  We anticipate that requiring notification for accidental breaches will 
encourage telecommunications carriers to adopt stronger data security practices and will help us identify 
and confront systemic network vulnerabilities.  Do commenters agree with the foregoing analysis?  Are

there other policy factors the Commission should consider in determining whether to require disclosure 
for unintentional breaches?  What are the benefits and burdens associated with this proposal?  We note 
that state data breach laws overwhelmingly do not include an intent limitation,49 and we seek comment on 
how state and other federal data breach laws should influence the policy we adopt.
13. We seek comment on the impact of requiring reporting of accidental breaches on the 
number of reported breaches.  Do commenters foresee a significant increase in the number of reported 
breaches?  If so, how would our proposal affect reporting costs for telecommunications carriers and is that 
burden outweighed by the benefits to customers, who may need to take actions to protect their personal 
and financial information whether or not the breach was intentional?  Would removing the intentionality 
limit potentially risk over-notification of data breaches to customers?  What would the impacts of over-
notification be?  Would the potential benefits outweigh any potential harm?  To help us assess the burden 
to both carriers and consumers from requiring reporting of accidental breaches, we invite commenters to 
provide estimates on the total number of breaches they have detected over the past few years, as well as 
the number of people affected by those breaches, and the severity of the compromised CPNI.
14. We propose to revise our definition to define a breach as any instance in which a person, 
without authorization or exceeding authorization, has gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.  We seek 
comment on this proposal and other possible definitions.  Should we retain the intent limitation in certain 
contexts?  If so, what contexts and why?  With only a few exceptions, the vast majority of state statutes 
include a provision exempting from the definition of breach a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an 
employee or agent of the company where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed.50

Should we include such an exemption in our definition of “breach” or is such a provision unnecessary or 
otherwise inadvisable?  Is our proposed rule sufficient to capture all instances in which persons, either 
purposefully or inadvertently, gain access to, use, or disclose CPNI?  If not, how should we revise our 
proposed rule to ensure that it does?  We also seek comment on whether we should expand the definition 
of a breach to include situations where a telecommunications carrier or a third party discovers conduct 
that could have reasonably led to exposure of customer CPNI, even if it has not yet determined if such 
exposure occurred.51  
15. Harm-Based Notification Trigger.  We seek comment on whether to forego requiring 
notification to customers or law enforcement of a breach in those instances where a telecommunications 
carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the 
breach.  Our current rule requires no showing of harm, instead requiring that notification be furnished in 
every instance where a breach of a carrier’s customers’ CPNI has occurred, where such breach is defined 
as any instance when “a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally 
gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.”52
16. We seek comment on the benefits and drawbacks of adopting a “harm-based” notification 
trigger.  How would it impact consumers?  Would it benefit consumers by avoiding confusion and “notice 
fatigue” with respect to breaches that are unlikely to cause harm?  Recognizing that it is not only 
distressing, but time consuming and expensive, to deal with the fallout of a data breach, we seek comment 
on whether a harm-based notification trigger could save consumers the time, effort, and financial 
difficulty of changing their passwords, purchasing fraud alerts or credit monitoring, and freezing their 
credit in the wake of a breach that is not reasonably likely to result in harm.  Alternatively, does a harm-
based notification trigger risk that consumers would be unaware of important information regarding their 
CPNI?  We note that a harm-based trigger has a basis in data breach notification frameworks employed 
by states, which generally do not require covered entities to notify customers of breaches when a 
determination is made that the breach is unlikely to cause harm.53  How should state and other data breach 
laws influence our analysis?
17. We also seek comment on the potential impacts of adopting a harm-based trigger on 
telecommunications carriers.  Would a harm-based trigger allow carriers to better focus their resources on 
data security and ameliorating the harms caused by data breaches?  Or to the contrary, would a harm-
51 For example, in 2017 Verizon notified the public that an employee of one of its vendors had put information in 
cloud storage with settings that could have allowed it to be exposed to the public even though it did not result in “a 
loss or theft of Verizon or Verizon customer information” because the issue was remedied before any public 
exposure occurred.  Verizon, Verizon responds to report: Confirms no loss or theft of customer information (July 12,

based trigger require carriers to unnecessarily expend resources determining whether particular breaches 
are reasonably likely to cause harm instead of more efficiently providing notice?
18. If we adopt a harm-based trigger, how should telecommunications carriers and the 
Commission determine the likelihood of misuse or harm?  Should we identify a standard or set of factors 
that telecommunications carriers must consider to evaluate whether no harm to customers is reasonably 
likely?54  If so, what factors should carriers consider in making their evaluation?  We preliminarily 
believe that no single factor on its own (e.g., basic encryption) is sufficient to make a determination 
regarding harm to customers.  Do commenters agree?  Do carriers have sufficient expertise and 
experience to determine whether a breach is likely to result in harm?  Should we establish a rebuttable 
presumption of consumer harm unless and until a carrier demonstrates that no harm to consumers is 
reasonably likely to occur as a result of a breach?55
19. We seek comment on whether we should clarify the definition of “misuse” or “harm.”56  
For example, should we construe “harm” broadly to encompass not only financial, but also physical and 
emotional harm, including reputational damage, personal embarrassment, and loss of control over the 
exposure of intimate personal details?  Should we require telecommunications carriers to consider 
whether other information about the customers that may be available combined with CPNI could result in 
harm when determining whether notification is required?  Should any harm-based trigger apply even 
where the data breached is encrypted?  What are the potential enforcement and compliance implications 
associated with this approach?  Should breaches without such “harm” be reported to the Commission 
even if not reported to customers?  Should we require the carrier to consult with federal law enforcement 
and/or the Commission prior to determining that there is no reasonable likelihood of harm or misuse?57  
We seek comment on whether there are other triggers we should consider for which notice would be 
unnecessary, such as the number of affected consumers or the length of time exposure occurred.  Are 
there other factors that we should consider before requiring breach notifications?  Should we adopt a 
harm-based trigger only if we require notices of unintentional breaches, or should we evaluate the two 
issues independently?  We also seek comment on the current notification practices in the industry.  How 
do carriers currently make decisions regarding whether to notify customers and law enforcement of a 
breach?
20. We seek comment on whether any harm-based notification trigger should apply to both

risk of harm to potentially affected individuals resulting from a breach); 45 CFR § 164.402(2) (setting forth a list of 
four factors that covered entities must consider when determining whether an acquisition, access, use, or disclosure 
of protected health information demonstrates a sufficiently high probability of harm so as to constitute a breach and 
trigger the notification requirements under HIPAA).

notifications to customers and notifications to law enforcement.  While there are legitimate reasons to 
consider eliminating notifications to customers in those instances where a breach is not reasonably likely 
to result in harm—including reducing confusion, stress, financial hardship, and notice fatigue—can the 
same be said of notifications to law enforcement?  Are there compelling reasons for carriers to continue 
notifying law enforcement of data breaches even where such breaches are not reasonably likely to result 
in consumer harm?  Do the benefits of notifying law enforcement of all breaches, regardless of whether  
the breach is likely to result in harm, outweigh the attendant costs to carriers of providing such notice?
21. We propose that if we adopt a harm-based trigger, where a carrier is unable to make a 
determination regarding harm or is uncertain whether harm is likely to occur, the obligation to notify 
would remain.  We seek comment on this proposal.
22. We also recognize that telecommunications carriers possess proprietary information other 
than CPNI that customers have an interest in protecting from public exposure, such as Social Security 
Numbers and financial records.  We seek comment on the Commission’s authority to establish breach-
reporting obligations for this type of information under Section 222, to the extent that this information is 
obtained by a telecommunications carrier in its activity as a common carrier.58  We also seek comment on 
the role of the Commission in protecting such information in light of the existing role of other agencies, 
including the FTC and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).59  If we were to require 
telecommunications carriers to report breaches of proprietary information other than CPNI under Section 
222(a), how broadly or narrowly should we define that category of information?  If we were to extend our 
data breach rule to cover such information, how could we minimize duplicative reporting obligations 
from the FTC and CISA?
B. Notifying the Commission and other Federal Law Enforcement of Data Breaches
23. Commission Notification.  We propose to require telecommunications carriers to notify 
the Commission of breaches, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable, and seek 
comment on our proposal.  Our proposal is consistent with other federal sector-specific laws, which 
require prompt notification to the relevant subject-matter agency.  For example, both HIPAA and the 
Health Breach Notification Rule require notice to the department of Health and Human Services (HHS) 
and the FTC respectively.60  We seek comment on the benefits and costs of requiring notification to the 
Commission in addition to notifying the Secret Service and the FBI, as our existing rules require.61
24. As discussed above, the Commission adopted its existing data breach rule to address 
concerns regarding pretexting practices.62  The Commission found that notifying law enforcement of 
CPNI breaches is consistent with the goal of protecting CPNI because it enables law enforcement to 
investigate the breach, “which could result in legal action against the perpetrators, thus ensuring that they 
do not continue to breach CPNI.”63  Moreover, the Commission anticipated that law enforcement 
investigations into how breaches occurred would enable law enforcement to advise the carrier and the 
Commission to take steps to prevent future breaches of that kind.64  However, as we have seen in the 
58 15 U.S.C. § 45(a) (prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, but exempting 
“common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce”), 44 (defining “Acts to regulate commerce” as 
including “the Communications Act of 1934 and all Acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto”).

years since our data breach rule was initially adopted, not all breaches of customer data are the result of 
criminal pretexting, which was Commission’s sole focus in 2007.  Large-scale security breaches can also 
be the result of lax or inadequate data security practices and employee training.  Thus, we tentatively 
conclude that notification of breaches will provide Commission staff important information about data 
security vulnerabilities that Commission staff can help address and remediate.  We anticipate that breach 
notification to the Commission will also shed light on carriers’ ongoing compliance with our rules.  We 
seek comment on these tentative conclusions.  How much of an incremental burden is associated with 
notifying the Commission of data breaches as compared to the existing data breach notification 
requirement for the Secret Service and FBI?  Are there any other government entities to which we should 
require data breach reporting, such as the FTC?  What would be the benefits and burdens of doing so?
25. Method of Notification.  We propose that the Commission create and maintain a 
centralized portal for reporting breaches to the Commission and other federal law enforcement agencies, 
and we seek comment on our proposal.  Our current breach notification rule requires that 
telecommunications carriers notify the FBI and Secret Service “through a central reporting facility” to 
which the Commission maintains a link on its website.65  We believe that the creation and operation by 
the Commission of a centralized reporting facility for reporting of breaches to the Commission, Secret 
Service, and FBI will streamline the notification process and improve federal coordination.  Do 
commenters agree?  Are there alternative mechanisms for breach reporting to the Commission and other 
federal law enforcement that we should consider instead, such as leveraging the existing central reporting 
facility?  Are there existing notification resources that we can leverage?  For example, could we leverage 
the CISA Incident Reporting System66 to minimize burdens on carriers?
26. We seek comment on how we can minimize data breach reporting burdens for 
telecommunications carriers.  The recently-passed Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure 
Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) requires covered entities to notify CISA of cyber security incidents and establishes 
an interagency Cyber Incident Reporting Council intended to streamline interagency cyber incident 
reporting.67  When implemented, CIRCIA will require covered entities to report cybersecurity incidents to 
CISA, except where covered entities “by law, regulation, or contract” are already required to report 
“substantially similar information to another Federal agency within a substantially similar timeframe,”68 
in which case the other agency will report the incident to CISA.69  To the extent that a breach of CPNI is a 
result of a cyber incident, we seek comment on whether there are any modifications to our proposed rules 
that would minimize potential duplicate reporting of such breaches.
27. Contents.  We seek comment on applying our existing requirements regarding the 
contents of the data breach notification to federal law enforcement agencies to breaches reported to the 
Commission.  Generally, the central reporting facility requires carriers to report information relevant to 
the breach, including carrier contact information; a description of the breach incident; the method of 
65 47 CFR § 64.2011(b).  See Federal Communications Commission, CPNI Breach Reporting Facility,

compromise; the date range of the incident, approximate number of customers affected; an estimate of 
financial loss to the carriers and customers, if any; types of data breached; and the addresses of affected 
customers.  We believe that the information currently submitted through the FBI/Secret Service reporting 
facility is largely sufficient, and that generally the same information should be reported under the rule we 
propose here.  Do commenters agree?  Are there any additional or alternative categories of information 
that should be included in these disclosures?  For example, should we require telecommunications carriers 
to report, at a minimum, the information required under CIRCIA with the aim of minimizing potentially 
duplicate reporting requirements?70  Should we curtail or streamline any of the existing content 
requirements?  For example, should we eliminate the requirement that carriers report the addresses of 
affected individuals to law enforcement and the Commission, to minimize the personal information 
reported to the Commission and law enforcement?
28. Timeframe.   We seek comment on the appropriate timeframe for notifying the 
Commission and other federal law enforcement of a breach.  Our current rule requires 
telecommunications carriers to notify the Secret Service and the FBI of all breaches of CPNI no later than 
seven business days after reasonable determination of the breach.71  We propose to require carriers to 
notify the Commission of a reportable breach contemporaneously with notification to other law 
enforcement agencies as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach.  We believe that requiring 
carriers to notify the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI at the same time will minimize burdens on 
carriers, eliminate confusion regarding obligations, and streamline the reporting process, allowing carriers 
to free up resources that can be used to address the breach and prevent further harm.  We seek comment 
on our proposal.  Is “as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach” an appropriate timeframe for 
notifying law enforcement after reasonable determination of a CPNI breach?  Or, should we maintain the 
current “no later than seven business days” standard?  Is there an alternative timeframe we should adopt 
for reporting CPNI breaches to the Commission and other federal law enforcement such as 24 hours or 72 
hours as has been proposed in other contexts,72 or should we consider adopting a graduated timeframe?73  
We also seek comment on whether we should clarify when a carrier should be treated as having 
“reasonably determined” that a breach has occurred.  Should a carrier be held to have “reasonably 
determined” a breach has occurred when it has information indicating that it is more likely than not that 
there was a breach?  Should we publish guidance on what constitutes a reasonable determination?  Should 
we adopt a more definite standard?
29. Threshold Trigger.  We seek comment on whether it is appropriate to set a threshold for 
the number of customers affected to require a breach report to the Commission, Secret Service, and/or 
FBI.  We observe that breaches affecting smaller numbers of customers may not necessitate the same law 
enforcement attention as larger breaches because they may be less likely to reflect coordinated attacks on 
CPNI.  Under our current rule, telecommunications carriers must notify federal law enforcement of all 
70 See CIRCIA, sec. 2242(b)(4) (requiring, at a minimum, a description of the covered cyber incident; a description 
of the vulnerabilities exploited and security defense that were in place, as well as the techniques used to perpetrate 
the covered incident; any identifying information related to those reasonably believed to be responsible for the 
incident; the categories of information reasonably believed to have been accessed or acquired by unauthorized 
persons; and contact information of the covered entity impacted).
71 47 CFR § 64.2011(a)-(b).
72 CIRCIA requires covered entities to notify CISA no later than 72 hours after the entity “reasonably believes” that 
a covered cybersecurity incident has occurred, and to report ransomware payments within 24 hours.  See CIRCIA, 
sec. 2242(a)(1)(A); 2242(a)(2).  The GDPR requires notification of a personal data breach to the relevant 
government authority within 72 hours of discovery of the breach.  Council Directive 2016/679, art. 33, 2016 O.J. (L 
119) 1 (EC).  
73  See, e.g. , Executive Order 14028 (mandating updates to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that will require, 
among other things, federal contractors to report cyber incidents  “based on a graduated scale of severity, with 
reporting on the most severe cyber incidents not to exceed 3 days after initial detection”).    
579Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102
reportable breaches, regardless of the number of customers affected.  Setting a threshold for the number 
of customers affected for breach reporting to the Secret Service and FBI could reduce the administrative 
burdens on carriers and law enforcement agencies from excessive reporting, and is consistent with many 
state statutes requiring notice to state law enforcement authorities, which require law enforcement 
notification of large breaches.
30. At the same time, establishing a threshold may limit our and our federal partners’ abilities 
to remediate, investigate, and deter smaller breaches.  Further, as the Commission has previously found, 
notification of all breaches could allow the Commission and federal law enforcement to be “better 
positioned than individual carriers to develop expertise about the methods and motives associated with 
CPNI breaches.”74  Is this still the case, given the development of data breach law and practices since 
2007?  Should we adopt a threshold for reporting to federal law enforcement?  If so, should the threshold 
be the same for the Commission as for federal law enforcement?  If not, how should the threshold differ?   
What would be an appropriate threshold for reporting?  Most states that adopt a threshold for reporting to 
law enforcement or government agencies require reporting at 250,75 500,76 or 100077 individuals affected.  
What reporting threshold would meet the needs of law enforcement and provide adequate safeguards?   
What are the benefits and drawbacks of setting a threshold, particularly for small carriers?  If we adopt a 
threshold trigger, should we require carriers to maintain a record of smaller breaches that fall below the 
threshold and report such small breaches to the Commission in a report at the end of the year?78  What are 
the benefits and drawbacks to such an approach?  Rather than a numerical threshold, should we instead 
consider requiring carriers to report only intentional breaches to law enforcement, but to report all 
breaches, whether intentional or inadvertent, to the Commission?
C. Customer Notification
31. Notifying Customers of Data Breaches without Unreasonable Delay.  We propose to 
require telecommunications carriers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay 
after discovery of a breach and notification to law enforcement, unless law enforcement requests a delay.  
We seek comment on our proposal.  Our existing data breach rule prohibits telecommunications carriers 
from notifying customers or disclosing the breach to the public until at least seven full business days after 
74 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6943, para. 27.
75 See, e.g. , N.D. Cent. Code § 51-30-02 (requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 250 residents or more to 
the state Attorney General); Or. Rev. Stat. § 646A.604(1)(b) (same); S.D. Codified Laws § 20-40-20 (same).
76 See, e.g. , Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.82(f) (requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 500 residents or more to 
the state Attorney General); Colo. Rev. Stat. § 6-1-716 (requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 500 
residents or more to the state Attorney General); Del. Code tit. 6, § 12B-102(d) (same); Fla. Stat. § 501.171(3)(a) 
(same); R.I. Gen. Laws § 11-49.3-4(a)(2) (requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 500 residents or more 
to the state Attorney General and major credit reporting agencies); see also 45 CFR § 164.408 (requiring notification 
to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for breaches of unsecured protected health information involving 
500 or more individuals).
77 See, e.g. , Ala. Admin. Code § 8-38-6(a) (requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 1000 residents or 
more to the state Attorney General); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 18-552 (requiring entities to report data breaches 
affecting 1000 residents or more to the state Attorney General and three largest nationwide consumer reporting 
agencies); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 487N-2 (requiring entities to report data breaches affecting 1000 residents or more to 
the state Office of Consumer Protection); N.M. Code § 57-12C-10 (requiring entities to report data breaches 
affecting 1000 residents or more to the state Attorney General and major consumer reporting agencies); Colo. Rev. 
Stat. § 6-1-716 (requiring entities to report data breaches affected 1000 residents or more to the credit reporting 
agencies).
78 See, e.g. , 45 CFR § 164.408(c) (requiring covered entities to maintain a log of breaches affecting less than 500 
individuals and provide the log to Department of Health and Human Services not later than 60 days after the end of 
each calendar year). 
580Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102
notification to the Secret Service and FBI.79  In cases where a carrier believes that there is an 
extraordinarily urgent need to notify affected customers in order to avoid immediate and irreparable harm, 
our rules permit carriers to notify affected customers after consultation with relevant investigating 
agencies.80  In adopting the existing rule, the Commission concluded that once customers have been 
notified, a breach may become public knowledge, “thereby impeding law enforcement’s ability to 
investigate the breach, identify the perpetrators, and determine how the breach occurred.”81  In short, the 
Commission found, “immediate customer notification may compromise all the benefits of requiring 
carriers to notify law enforcement of CPNI breaches,” and therefore a short delay was warranted.82
32. We tentatively conclude that this existing approach is out-of-step with current approaches 
regarding the urgency of notifying victims about breaches of their personal information.  We tentatively 
conclude that our proposal better serves the public interest than our current rule because it increases the 
speed at which customers may receive the important information contained in a notice, except in those 
specific circumstances when law enforcement officials specifically request otherwise.83  We seek 
comment on our tentative conclusion.  What are the benefits and drawbacks to such an approach?  Is there 
any reason to maintain our current absolute bar to customer notification for a set period?  Does our 
proposal to eliminate the seven business-day waiting period before notifying customers appropriately 
balance legitimate law enforcement needs with the customers’ need to take action to timely protect their 
information after a breach?  We seek comment on whether a “without unreasonable delay” notification 
requirement would allow carriers enough time to determine the scope and impact of a breach.  Would 
prompt customer notification compromise a carrier’s ability to discover the source of the breach, mitigate 
the loss of data, and ensure further data is not compromised?
33. Our proposed requirement is consistent with many existing data breach notification laws 
that require expedited notice but refrain from requiring a specific timeframe.  For example, the GLBA 
requires customer notification “as soon as possible” after a determination that customer information has 
been misused.84  California law requires notification “be made in the most expedient time possible and 
without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement.”85  Similarly, many 
state data breach statutes impose an “expeditiously as practicable” or “without unreasonable delay” 
standard instead of a set time limit for reporting.86  In addition, FTC guidance on addressing data breaches 
explains that “if you quickly notify people that their personal information has been compromised, they 
can take steps to reduce the chance that their information will be misused.”87  How should state and other 
federal law influence the approach we adopt?

34. We seek comment on whether requiring notice to customers “without unreasonable 
delay” after discovery of a breach provides sufficient guidance as to the required timeframe to notify 
customers.  Should we adopt a different approach, such as a fixed number of days for notification, and if 
so what should we adopt?  If we were to adopt a “without unreasonable delay” standard, we seek 
comment on whether we should provide guidance on a specific time period that would be considered 
“reasonable” for notification.  For example, HIPAA requires notification to individuals “without 
unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach.”88  The Health 
Breach Notification Rule also requires notification to individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no 
case later than 60 days after the discovery of a breach of security.”89  Most states that impose an outside 
limit on when consumers must be notified of a breach require notification to affected consumers no later 
than 30,90 45,91 or 6092 days after discovery of a breach.  What are the benefits and drawbacks to setting a 
definite time limit on notification while requiring notification without unreasonable delay?
35. We also seek comment on whether the same notification deadline should be applied to all 
carriers.  Are there unique concerns or compliance barriers for small carriers that make prompt response 
unfeasible, such as resource availability or reliance on third-party cybersecurity services for breach 
detection?  Should we adopt different notification requirements for small carriers?  If so, what threshold 
should we establish for small carriers?  Should we consider establishing any other exceptions to this 
proposed requirement?  We also seek comment on whether we should take into consideration the scope of 
the breach, e.g., how many customers are affected, the type of information breach, in determining the 
appropriate timeframe for customer breach reporting.
36. We seek comment on how best to coordinate the timing of customer notification and 
federal law enforcement notification.  Our current rule, providing for consecutive rather than 
simultaneous notification of federal law enforcement and customers, was adopted at the request of federal 
law enforcement.93  Is such an approach still necessary?  Are there circumstances where it would be 
acceptable for carriers to notify customers and law enforcement simultaneously in certain instances?  
Given that nearly all, if not all, state data breach statutes subject the timing of customer notification to 
legitimate law enforcement needs,94 we seek comment on whether it is necessary to provide any further 
guidance to help coordinate the timing of notice to customers with notice to the Commission and other 
federal law enforcement.
37. In addition, consistent with our current rules implementing section 222, our proposed 
rules would allow a federal agency to direct a carrier to delay customer notification for an initial period of 
up to 30 days if such notification would interfere with a criminal investigation or national security.95  In 
88 45 CFR § 164.404(b).  For breaches involving more than 500 individuals, HIPAA also requires notification of 
“prominent media outlets serving the state or jurisdiction” without unreasonable delay and no later than 60 days.  45 
CFR § 164.406.  For breaches involving more than 500 individuals HIPAA also requires notification to the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HSS).  45 CFR § 164.408.

582Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102
circumstances when a carrier reasonably decides to consult with law enforcement, a short delay pending 
such consultation would likely be reasonable for purposes of a “without unreasonable delay” standard for 
customer notification.  We seek comment on this proposal.  We observe that HIPAA, the GLBA, and the 
Health Breach Notification Rules allow for a delay of customer notification if law enforcement 
determines notification to customers would “impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national 
security,” but only if law enforcement officials request such a delay.96  Both HIPAA and the Health 
Breach Notification Rule allow notification delays of up to 30 days if requested by law enforcement.97  
Similarly, GLBA allows that “customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency 
determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a 
written request for a delay.”98  Likewise, most, if not all, states permit delays in notifying affected 
consumers for legitimate law enforcement needs.99  We tentatively conclude that our proposal strikes an 
appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement to have time to investigate criminal activity 
and the needs of customers to be notified of data breaches.  Do commenters agree?  We also observe that 
these other regimes appear to allow non-federal law enforcement to request a delay, whereas the 
Commission’s rule currently allows only federal agencies to so request.100  Should our rule also allow 
carriers to delay notification upon request of non-federal law enforcement?
38. Contents of Customer Breach Notification.  We seek comment on whether we should 
require customer breach notifications to include specific minimum categories of information.  Our current 
rules specify when and to whom breach notifications must be made, but do not address the content of 
such notifications.101  In adopting the current breach notification rules, the Commission declined to 
specify the precise content of the notice that must be provided to customers in the event of a security 
breach of CPNI, “leav[ing] carriers the discretion to tailor the language and method of notification to the 
circumstances.”102  Nearly 15 years later, we now seek comment on whether it is appropriate to require a 
minimum amount of information to ensure that such data breach notifications contain actionable 
information that is useful to the consumer.  We seek comment on the benefits to customers and carriers of 
requiring carriers to include minimum categories of information in customer data breach notices.  Will 
having minimum consistent fields of information assist consumers in understanding the circumstances 
and nature of the breach and streamline notice practices for carriers?  What are the drawbacks to doing 
so?  Are there any legal barriers to adopting a rule that prescribes the minimum categories of information 
in these breach notices?
39. To so identify possible categories of information to require, we look to numerous state

data breach statutes as well as existing federal guidance regarding data breach notices.  All 50 states, the 
District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have laws requiring private or 
governmental entities to notify individuals of breaches involving their personal information.103  Of these, 
many impose minimum content requirements on the notifications that must be transmitted to affected 
individuals in the wake of a data breach,104 including: the name and contact information for the entity 
reporting the breach;105 the date, estimated date, or estimated date range of the breach;106 a description of 
the breach incident;107 a description of the personally identifiable information that was used, disclosed, or 
accessed, or reasonably believed to have been used, disclosed, or accessed;108 any actions the entity is 
taking to remedy the situation and/or protect affected individuals;109 a brief list of steps that affected 
consumers can take to protect themselves and their information, such as contacting credit bureaus to ask 
that fraud alerts or credit freezes be placed on their credit reports;110 and contact information for the FTC 
and any federal agency that assists consumers with matters of identity theft.111  Similarly, both the HIPAA 
Breach Notification Rule and guidance issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 
response to the GLBA impose minimum content requirements on data breach notifications.112  In its Data

Breach Response Guide, the FTC advises companies on specific information that should be included in 
their breach notices to individuals, including describing what the company knows about the breach (how 
it happened, what information was taken, how the thieves have used the information (if known), what 
actions the company has taken to remedy the situation, what actions the company is taking to protect 
individuals, how to reach the relevant contact in the organization); the steps individuals can take, given 
the type of information exposed, and provide relevant contact information; current information about how 
to recover from identity theft; information about the law enforcement agency working on the case, if the 
law enforcement agency agrees that would help; encouraging people who discover that their information 
has been misused to report it to the FTC; and describing how the company will contact consumers in the 
future to help victims avoid phishing scams.113
40. We seek comment on adapting these models to telecommunications carriers and requiring 
carriers to include, at a minimum, the following information in security breach notices to customers:  (1) 
the date of the breach; (2) a description of the customer information that was used, disclosed, or accessed; 
(3) information on how customers, including customers with disabilities, can contact the carrier to inquire 
about the breach; (4) information about how to contact the Commission, FTC, and any state regulatory 
agencies relevant to the customer and the service; (5) if the breach creates a risk of identity theft, 
information about national credit reporting agencies and the steps customers can take to guard against 
identity theft, including any credit monitoring, credit reporting, or credit freezes the carrier is offering to 
affected customers; and (6) what other steps customers should take to mitigate their risk based on the 
specific categories of information exposed in the breach.  Are the identified categories the correct 
information to be included in data breach notices?  Should we consider requiring any additional or 
alternative categories of information that carriers must include in customer breach notices?  For example, 
would it be helpful to include a statement of whether the notification was delayed due to reporting 
requirements to law enforcement or a law enforcement investigation, and if so, the length of the delay to 
help explain to customers the time lapse between discovery of the breach and customer notification?114  
Should we require notifications to include a list of the law enforcement and government entities that have 
been notified of the breach?  Should we require carriers to include a brief description of how the carrier 
will contact consumers in the future regarding the breach to help consumers avoid phishing scams related 
to breaches?  What are best practices for providing consumers with actionable information in a breach 
notification?  We seek comment on what minimum required information appropriately balances 
empowering consumers to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their information in the 
wake of a data breach and appropriately limiting burdens on telecommunications carriers.  We also seek 
comment on whether adopting or adapting a set of existing notification contents requirements will help to 
create a measure of consistency across breach notifications and will benefit both consumers and carriers, 
particularly smaller carriers, by streamlining the manner and content of their response in the event of a 
data breach.
41. Method of Customer Breach Notification.  We observe that many state regulations 
specify the form that notifications to customers may take, whether by physical mail, email, or 
telephone.115  We seek comment on whether we should adopt a similar requirement and, if so, on what 
form notifications to consumers should take.  Is there a method or methods of notification that would 
make the most sense or be most beneficial to consumers?  What are the benefits and burdens of imposing 
such a requirement?

D. TRS Breach Reporting
42. In 2013, the Commission adopted CPNI rules applicable to all forms of 
Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), as well as to point-to-point video calls handled over the video 
relay services (VRS) network.116  The Commission found that “for TRS to be functionally equivalent to 
voice telephone services, consumers with disabilities who use TRS are entitled to have the same 
assurances of privacy as do consumers without disabilities for voice telephone services.”117  The CPNI 
rules for TRS include a breach notification rule that is equivalent to section 64.2011 in terms of the 
substantive protection provided to TRS users.118  To maintain functional equivalency for TRS users, we 
propose to amend section 64.5111 so that it continues to provide equivalent privacy protection for TRS 
users.  The amendments we propose for section 64.5111 are thus essentially the same as those proposed 
for users of telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services.  That is, we propose: (1) to expand the 
Commission’s definition of “breach” to include inadvertent disclosures of customer information; (2) to 
require TRS providers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as 
practicable after discovery of a breach; and (3) to eliminate the mandatory waiting period to notify 
customers, instead requiring TRS providers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable 
delay after discovery of a breach unless law enforcement requests a delay.  Further, we seek comment on 
the following additional issues, raised above regarding section 64.2011, as they relate to TRS providers:  
(1) whether to adopt a harm-based trigger for breach notifications; (2) whether we should adopt minimum 
requirements for the content of customer breach notices; and (3) whether our rules should address 
breaches of sensitive personal information.
43. We seek comment on each of these proposals and their costs and benefits.  Should 
updated data breach requirements for TRS providers be identical to those we adopt for providers of 
telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services, or are there circumstances unique to TRS 
providers that warrant differences in their obligations regarding data breaches?  Are any additional 
notification requirements necessary to ensure TRS users receive functionally equivalent privacy 
protection?  If we adopt the proposed requirement that service providers notify the Commission of 
breaches via a centralized portal, is there any need to retain the current requirement that TRS providers 
submit a copy of any breach notification to the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and 
Governmental Affairs Bureau?119  Finally, would TRS providers incur costs or other compliance burdens 
under the proposed amendments that are disproportionately greater than those incurred by providers of 
telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services, and if so, would the extent of such costs or 
burdens justify the application of different breach notification requirements to TRS?
44. Legal Authority.  Section 225 of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that TRS are 
available to enable communication in a manner that is functionally equivalent to voice telephone 
services.120  In 2013, the Commission found that applying the privacy protections of the Commission’s 
116 Structure and Practices of the Video Relay Service Program; Telecommunications Relay Services and Speech-to-
Speech Services for Individuals with Hearing and Speech Disabilities, CG Docket Nos. 10-51 and 03-123, Report 
and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 28 FCC Rcd 8618, 8680-87, para. 155-172 (2013) (2013 
VRS Reform Order); 47 CFR §§ 64.5101-64.5111 (TRS CPNI rules).  This includes the breach notification rule.  See 
47 CFR § 64.5111. 
117 2013 VRS Reform Order, 28 FCC Rcd at 8683, para. 164
118 The texts of the two provisions are virtually identical, except for the substitution of the term “TRS provider” for 
“telecommunications carrier” in section 64.5111.  Compare 47 CFR § 64.2011 with 47 CFR § 64.5111.  The only 
substantive difference is that under the TRS rule, after a TRS provider notifies law enforcement of a breach, it “shall 
file a copy of the notification with the Disability Rights Office of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau at 
the same time as when the TRS provider notifies the customers.”  47 CFR § 64.5111(a).

CPNI regulations to TRS users advances the functional equivalency of TRS.121  The Commission 
concluded further that the specific mandate of section 225 to establish “functional requirements, 
guidelines, and operations procedures for TRS” authorizes the Commission to make the privacy 
protections of the Commission’s CPNI regulations applicable to TRS users.122  In addition, the 
Commission found that extending the CPNI regulations to TRS users is ancillary to its responsibilities 
under section 222 of the Act to telecommunications service subscribers that place calls to or receive calls 
from TRS users, because TRS call records include call detail information concerning all calling and called 
parties.123  Finally, the Commission determined that applying CPNI requirements to point-to-point video 
services provided by VRS providers124 is ancillary to its responsibilities under sections 222 and 225.125
45. We tentatively conclude that, for the same reasons cited in the 2013 VRS Reform Order, 
these sources of authority for establishing the current CPNI rules for TRS authorize the Commission to 
amend those rules to ensure that TRS users receive privacy protections equivalent to those proposed for 
users of telecommunications and VoIP services.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion.
E. Legal Authority 
46. Section 222.  We believe that section 222 provides authority to adopt the breach 
notification rules for which we seek comment in this Notice .126  We also tentatively conclude that we have 
authority to apply the rules proposed in this Notice to interconnected VoIP providers.  We seek comment 
on these tentative conclusions.
47. Section 222 of the Act governs telecommunications carriers in their use, disclosure, and 
protection of proprietary information that they obtain in the course of providing telecommunications 
services.  Section 222(a) imposes a duty on carriers to “protect the confidentiality of proprietary 
information of, and relating to” customers, fellow carriers, and equipment manufacturers.127  Section 
222(c) imposes more specific requirements on carriers as to the protection and confidentiality of CPNI.128  
We tentatively conclude that both subsections provide us authority to adopt rules requiring 
telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers to address breaches of CPNI.
48. The Commission has long required carriers to report data breaches as part of their duty to 
protect the confidentiality of customers’ information.129  We believe that the proposed revisions to the 
Commission’s data breach reporting rule reinforce carriers’ duty to protect the confidentiality of their 
customers’ information.  Data breach reporting requirements also reinforce our other rules addressing the 
protection of CPNI.130  For example, data breach notifications can meaningfully inform customer 
decisions regarding whether to give, withhold, or retract their approval to use or disclose their 
information.  Similarly, we believe that requiring carriers to notify the Commission in the event of a data 
breach will better enable the Commission to identify and confront systemic network vulnerabilities and

help investigate and advise carriers on how best to avoid future breaches, also helping carriers to fulfill 
their duty under section 222(a) to protect the confidentiality of their customers’ information.  We seek 
comment on this analysis.
49. Interconnected VoIP.  We believe that we have authority under section 222 and our 
ancillary jurisdiction to apply the rules we propose today to interconnected VoIP providers.  In 2007, the 
Commission exercised ancillary jurisdiction to extend its Part 64 CPNI rules to interconnected VoIP 
services.131  Since then, interconnected VoIP providers have operated under these rules.  Interconnected 
VoIP services remain within the Commission’s subject matter jurisdiction and we believe that the 
application of customer privacy requirements to these services is “reasonably ancillary to the effective 
performance” of our statutory responsibility under section 222.132  As the Commission explained in 2007, 
“American consumers [can reasonably] expect that their telephone calls are private irrespective of 
whether the call is made using the service of a wireline carrier, a wireless carrier, or an interconnected 
VoIP provider.”133  Now, as then, extending section 222’s protections to interconnected VoIP service 
customers is also “necessary to protect the privacy of wireline or wireless customers that place calls to or 
receive calls from interconnected VoIP providers.”134  In addition, in 2008, Congress ratified the 
Commission’s decision to apply section 222’s requirements to interconnected VoIP services by adding 
language to section 222 that expressly covers “IP-enabled voice service,”135 defined expressly to 
incorporate the Commission’s definition of “interconnected VoIP service.”136  The 2008 revisions to 
section 222 would not make sense if the privacy-related duties of subsections (a) and (c) did not apply to 
interconnected VoIP providers.  We seek comment on this analysis.
50. We seek comment on whether there are other bases of authority on which we can rely to 
adopt the rules we propose and seek comment on today.
F. Impact of the Congressional Disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order
51. As noted above, in 2016, the Commission acted to revise its breach notification rule as 
part of a larger proceeding addressing privacy requirements for broadband internet access service 
providers (ISPs).137  The rules the Commission adopted in the 2016 Privacy Order  applied to 
telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers in addition to ISPs, which had been 
131 See 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6954-57, paras. 54-59; see also 47 CFR § 64.2003(o) (defining 
“telecommunications carrier or carrier” for purposes of the CPNI rules to include interconnected VoIP providers).
132 See 2007 CPNI Order, 22 FCC Rcd at 6955, para. 55; see also United States v. Southwestern Cable , 392 U.S.

654 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (holding that ancillary jurisdiction must be “necessary to further its regulation of activities over 
which [the Commission] does have express statutory authority”).

(defining “IP-enabled voice service” as having “the meaning given the term ‘interconnected VoIP service’ by 
section 9.3 of the Federal Communications Commission’s regulations (47 CFR 9.3)”).
137 2016 Privacy Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 14019-33, paras. 261-291.  In 2015, the Commission classified broadband 
Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to Title II of the Act, a decision that the D.C. Circuit 
upheld in United States Telecom Ass’n v. FCC.  See Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet, GN Docket No. 
14-28, Report and Order on Remand, Declaratory Ruling, and Order, 30 FCC Rcd 5601, 5733, paras. 306 (2015),  
aff’d, United States Telecom Ass’n v. FCC, 825 F.3d 674 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  As a result of classifying broadband 
Internet access service as a telecommunications service, such services were subject to section 222 of the Act.
588Federal Communications Commission FCC 22-102
classified as providers of telecommunications services in 2015.138  In 2017, however, Congress nullified 
those 2016 revisions to the Commission’s CPNI rules under the Congressional Review Act.139
52. As a threshold matter, we  seek comment on the effect of the Congressional disapproval 
of the 2016 Privacy Order under the Congressional Review Act.140  While we seek comment on a range 
of proposals in this item, we clarify that, in light of the Congressional resolution of disapproval, we are 
not seeking comment on “reissu[ing] . . . in substantially the same form,” or on issuing “a new rule that is 
substantially the same as,” the rule disapproved by Congress.141  More generally, though, we seek 
comment here on  the effect and scope of the Congressional disapproval of the 2016 Privacy Order for 
purposes of adopting rules that apply to telecommunications carriers.
G. Digital Equity Considerations
53. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,142 
including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely 
affected by persistent poverty and inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations143 and 
benefits (if any) that may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein.  Specifically, we 
seek comment on how our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility.
138 See 2016 Privacy Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 13925, para. 39, 14033-34, para. 293.  In 2017, the Commission 
reversed the 2015 classification decision so that Title II obligations, including section 222, no longer apply to ISPs.

all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or 
sex.”  47 U.S.C. § 151.
143 We define the term “equity” consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, 
and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have 
been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons 
otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  See Exec. Order No. 13985, 86 Fed. Reg. 7009,

APPENDIX B
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA), 1 the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on small entities by the policies and rules proposed in this Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (Notice).  The Commission requests written public comments on this IRFA.  Comments 
must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments provided on 
the first page of the Notice.  The Commission will send a copy of the Notice, including this IRFA, to the 
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the Notice and 
IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register. 3 
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules
2. The Commission first adopted a rule in 2007 requiring telecommunications carriers and 
interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers to notify customers and federal law 
enforcement of breaches of customer proprietary network information (CPNI) in the carriers’ possession.4  
In the almost decade and a half since that time, data breaches nationwide have increased in both 
frequency and severity in all industries.  In the telecommunications industry, the public has suffered an 
increasing number of security breaches of customer information in recent years.  Federal and state data 
breach laws covering other areas have evolved since 2007.  Those developments combined with our 
specific experience suggest opportunities for improvement in our own breach notification rule.  Today, 
we begin the process to update and strengthen our data breach rule to provide greater protections to the 
public.
3. The Commission adopted the data breach rule, like the rest of the privacy safeguards 
adopted in the 2007 CPNI Order, to address the problem of “pretexting,” the practice of pretending to be 
a particular customer or other authorized person in order to obtain access to that customer’s call detail or 
other private communications records.5  In the almost 15 years since, it has become clear that breaches of 
customer information in many contexts extend far beyond pretexting in general or the specific type of 
pretexting addressed at that time and are increasing in scale and evolving in methodology.  The increasing 
severity and diversifying methods of security breaches involving customer information can have lasting 
detrimental impacts on customers whose information has been breached.
4. To better protect telecommunications customers and ensure that our rules keep pace with 
today’s challenges, we propose a number of updates to our rule addressing telecommunications carriers’ 
breach notification duties.  We seek to ensure that affected customers, the Commission, and other federal 
law enforcement agencies receive the information they need in a timely manner so they can mitigate and 
prevent harm due to the breach and take action to deter future breaches.  To identify best practices and to 
minimize burdens, we look to other federal and state breach laws as potential models for our rules.
5. In this Notice, we propose to expand the Commission’s definition of “breach” to include 
inadvertent disclosures of customer information and seek comment on adopting a harm-based trigger for 
1 See 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, see 5 U.S.C. § 601-612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

breach notifications.  We also propose to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the 
Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach.   We also propose to eliminate 
the mandatory waiting period before notifying customers and instead require carriers to notify customers 
of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless law enforcement requests 
a delay.  We also seek comment on whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content of 
customer breach notices, and we seek comment on whether our rules should address breaches of other 
types of sensitive personal information beyond CPNI.  Finally, we propose to make changes to our TRS 
data breach reporting rule consistent with those we propose to our CPNI breach reporting rule.
B. Legal Basis

C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rules Will Apply
7. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules and by the rule revisions on which 
the Notice seeks comment, if adopted.6  The RFA generally defines the term “small entity” as having the 
same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” and “small governmental 
jurisdiction.”7  In addition, the term “small business” has the same meaning as the term “small-business 
concern” under the Small Business Act.8  A “small-business concern” is one which: (1) is independently 
owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria 
established by the SBA.9
8. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions .  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.10  First, while 
there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility 
analysis, according to data from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy, in 
general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.11  These types of 
small businesses represent 99.9 percent of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 
million businesses.12
9. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”13  The

7 See 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).
8 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small-business concern” in the Small Business 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.14  Nationwide, for tax year 2018, there 
were approximately 571,709 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less 
according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.15
10. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”16  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census 
of Governments17 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.18  Of this number there were 
36,931 general purpose governments (county,19 municipal and town or township20) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts21 with enrollment 
14 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction.  Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small 
organizations in this small entity description.  See IRS, Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard), Who May File Form 990-N to Satisfy Their Annual Reporting 
Requirement , https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-
organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard (last visited Aug. 2, 2021).  We note that the IRS data does not provide 
information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field.

estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.” 23
1. Wireline Carriers
11. Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as 
establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and 
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using 
wired communications networks.24  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a 
combination of technologies.  Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network 
facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including 
VoIP services, wired (cable) audio and video programming distribution, and wired broadband internet 
services.25  By exception, establishments providing satellite television distribution services using facilities 
and infrastructure that they operate are included in this industry.26  Wired Telecommunications Carriers 
are also referred to as wireline carriers or fixed local service providers.27
12. The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies 
firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.28  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there 
were 3,054 firms that operated in this industry for the entire year.29  Of this number, 2,964 firms operated 
with fewer than 250 employees.30  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service 
Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 5,183 providers that reported they were engaged 
in the provision of fixed local services.31  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 4,737 
22 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census 
of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments 
category.  Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments 
category.
23 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of 
Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10.

Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of 
December 31, 2020, there were 151 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
interexchange services.  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 131 providers have 1,500 or 
fewer employees.60  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, the Commission 
estimates that the majority of providers in this industry can be considered small entities.
17. Cable System Operators (Telecom Act Standard).  The Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended (the Act), also contains a size standard for small cable system operators, which is “a cable 
operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than one percent of all 
subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual 
revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.”61  For purposes of the Telecom Act Standard, the 
Commission determined that a cable system operator that serves fewer than 677,000 subscribers, either 
directly or through affiliates, will meet the definition of a small cable operator based on the cable 
subscriber count established in a 2001 Public Notice.62  Based on industry data, only six cable system 
operators have more than 677,000 subscribers.63  Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the 
majority of cable system operators are small under this size standard.  We note however, that the 
Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated 
with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 million.64  Therefore, we are unable at this time to 
estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small cable

62 FCC Announces New Subscriber Count for the Definition of Small Cable Operator, Public Notice, 16 FCC Rcd 
2225 (CSB 2001) (2001 Subscriber Count PN).  In this Public Notice, the Commission determined that there were 
approximately 67.7 million cable subscribers in the United States at that time using the most reliable source publicly 
available.  Id.  We recognize that the number of cable subscribers changed since then and that the Commission has 
recently estimated the number of cable subscribers to traditional and telco cable operators to be approximately 58.1 
million.  See Communications Marketplace Report, GN Docket No. 20-60, 2020 Communications Marketplace 
Report, 36 FCC Rcd 2945, 3049, para. 156 (2020) (2020 Communications Marketplace Report).  However, because 
the Commission has not issued a public notice subsequent to the 2001 Subscriber Count PN, the Commission still

for small businesses specifically applicable to other toll carriers.  This category includes toll carriers that 
do not fall within the categories of interexchange carriers, operator service providers, prepaid calling card 
providers, satellite service carriers, or toll resellers.  Wired Telecommunications Carriers65  is the closest 
industry with a SBA small business size standard.66  The SBA small business size standard for Wired 
Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 or fewer employees as small.67  U.S. Census 
Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.68  
Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.69  Additionally, based on 
Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 
115 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of other toll services.70  Of these 
providers, the Commission estimates that 113 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.71  Consequently, 
using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities.
2. Wireless Carriers
19. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.72  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.73  The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 
1,500 or fewer employees.74  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this 
industry that operated for the entire year.75  Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 
employees.76  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report,

as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
wireless services.77  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer 
employees.78  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers can be 
considered small entities.
20. Satellite Telecommunications.  This category comprises firms “primarily engaged in 
providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or 
reselling satellite telecommunications.”79  Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite 
and earth station operators. The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business 
with $38.5 million or less in annual receipts as small.80  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 275 
firms in this industry operated for the entire year.81  Of this number, 242 firms had revenue of less than 
$25 million.82 Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, 
as of December 31, 2020, there were 71 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
satellite telecommunications services.83  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that approximately 
48 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.84  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size 
standard, a little more than of these providers can be considered small entities.
3. Resellers
21. Local Resellers.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA have developed a small business 
size standard specifically for Local Resellers.  Telecommunications Resellers is the closest industry with 
a SBA small business size standard.85  The Telecommunications Resellers industry comprises 
establishments engaged in purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of 
telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless telecommunications services (except 
satellite) to businesses and households.86  Establishments in this industry resell telecommunications; they 
do not operate transmission facilities and infrastructure.87  Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) are

standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities.
23. Prepaid Calling Card Providers.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
small business definition specifically for prepaid calling card providers.  Telecommunications Resellers102 
is the closest industry with a SBA small business size standard.  The Telecommunications Resellers 
industry comprises establishments engaged in purchasing access and network capacity from owners and

year.106  Of that number, 1,375 firms operated with fewer than 250 employees.107  Additionally, based on 
Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 
58 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of payphone services.108  Of these 
providers, the Commission estimates that 57 providers have 1,500 or fewer employees.109  Consequently, 
using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers can be considered small entities.

engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications 
telemetry, and radar station operation.110  This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in 
providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial 
systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, 
satellite systems.111  Providers of Internet services (e.g. dial-up ISPs) or voice over Internet protocol 
(VoIP) services, via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.112

D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities
25. In this Notice, we propose to expand the Commission’s definition of “breach” to include 
inadvertent disclosures of customer information and seek comment on adopting a harm-based trigger for 
breach notifications.  We also propose to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the 
Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable after discovery of a breach.   We also propose to eliminate 
the mandatory waiting period before notifying customers and instead require carriers to notify customers 
of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach unless law enforcement requests 
a delay.  We also seek comment on whether we should adopt minimum requirements for the content of 
customer breach notices, and we seek comment on whether our rules should address breaches of other 
types of sensitive personal information beyond CPNI.  Finally, we propose to make changes to our TRS 
data breach reporting rule consistent with those we propose to our CPNI breach reporting rule.
26. Should the Commission decide to modify existing rules or adopt new rules to strengthen 
our data breach reporting rule, such action could potentially result in increased, reduced, or otherwise 
modified recordkeeping, reporting, or other compliance requirements for affected providers of service.  
We seek comment on the effect of any proposals on small entities.  Entities, especially small businesses, 
are encouraged to quantify the costs and benefits of any reporting, recordkeeping, or compliance 
requirement that may be established in this proceeding.
E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
27. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered 
in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others): (1) 
the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account 
the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of 
compliance and reporting requirements under the rules for such small entities; (3) the use of performance 
rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such 
small entities. 116
28. The Notice seeks comment on the particular impacts that the proposed rules may have on 
small entities.  Specifically, the Notice seeks comment on whether there are unique concerns or 
compliance barriers for small carriers that make notice to customers without unreasonable delay 
unfeasible;117 if there should be different notification requirements for small carriers;118 if streamlining

STATEMENT OF
CHAIRWOMAN JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re: Data Breach Reporting Requirements , WC Docket No. 22-21, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
(January 5, 2023).
Our mobile phones are in our palms, pockets, and purses.  We rarely go anywhere without them.  
There is good reason for this—the convenience and safety of being able to reach out anytime and virtually 
anywhere is powerful.  But this always-on connectivity means that our carriers have access to a treasure 
trove of data about who we are, where we have traveled, and who we have talked to.
It is vitally important that this deeply personal data does not fall into the wrong hands.  That is 
why the Federal Communications Commission has long had rules that require carriers to protect the 
privacy and security of data, under Section 222 of the Communications Act.  But the rules this agency has 
on the books that require carriers to notify consumers and law enforcement of data breaches under Section 
222 are more than 15 years old.  
That is why we kick off a proceeding to modernize our data breach rules here.  We propose to 
eliminate the outdated seven business day mandatory waiting period before notifying customers, require 
the reporting of inadvertent but harmful data breaches, and ensure that the agency is notified of major data 
breaches.  We also seek comment on how our breach reporting obligations can work alongside those 
forthcoming from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Cyber Incident 
Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act.  I look forward to the record that develops—and updating our 
policies under the law.

ORDER
Adopted:  January 4, 2023 Released:  January 9, 2023
By the Commission: 
I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Order, the Federal Communications Commission (the Commission or FCC) takes 
action to modernize and streamline its operations by making changes to its International Bureau as well as 
certain parts of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB) and Office of Managing Director 
(OMD).  In this Order, we amend the Commission’s rules to reflect these new organizational structures 
and describe the functions being realigned.  We find it appropriate to make these organizational changes 
to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission’s activities and operations.  In addition, 
we make other non-substantive rule revisions to reflect changes in Commission procedures and to 
modernize certain references to the Chairperson of the FCC. 
2. First, to better support United States leadership in the emerging space economy, to 
promote long-term technical capacity within the FCC to address non-federal satellite programs and 
policies, and to improve coordination with other agencies on issues related to space, we conclude that the 
proper dispatch of our business and the public interest will be served by reorganizing the International 
Bureau into: (1) a Space Bureau to handle policy and licensing matters related to satellite communications 
and other in-space activities under the Commission’s jurisdiction; and (2) an Office of International 
Affairs to handle issues involving foreign and international regulatory authorities as well as international 
telecommunications and submarine cable licensing.  We find these organizational changes will provide 
the FCC with the updated structure it needs to provide essential international leadership in the ever-
evolving global telecommunications marketplace.
3. In addition, to improve the efficiency of the agency’s operations, bolster the 
Commission’s records and document management systems, and enhance public access to critical public 
records, the Commission has concluded that the proper dispatch of its business and the public interest will 
be served by taking the following actions:
a. Transfer the Reference Information Center (RIC) from CGB to the Office of the 
Secretary in OMD;
b. Merge the records management program in OMD’s Performance Evaluation and Records 
Management (PERM) group with OMD’s Information Technology (IT) group; 
c. Rename PERM to be the Performance and Program Management (PPM) group in OMD; 
and
d. Transfer the Enterprise Acquisition Center (EAC) in the Front Office of OMD to a new 
608Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
stand-alone group in OMD.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Establishment of Space Bureau and Office of International Affairs and Elimination 
of International Bureau
4. Under this reorganization, the Space Bureau will promote a competitive and innovative 
global telecommunications marketplace via space services.  The Space Bureau will do so by undertaking 
policy analysis and rulemakings as well as authorizing satellite systems for the purpose of facilitating the 
deployment of satellite services, streamlining regulatory processes and maximizing flexibility for 
operators to meet customer needs, and fostering the efficient use of spectrum and orbital resources. The 
Space Bureau will also serve as a focal point for coordination with other U.S. government agencies on 
matters of space policy and governance, and will support the Office of International Affairs for meetings 
with other countries, international organizations and foreign government officials that involve space 
policy matters. 
5. The Office of International Affairs will develop international telecommunications policy 
to facilitate competition in the provision of international services and further U.S. strategic objectives in 
global telecommunications policy.  The Office of International Affairs will be responsible for policy 
development and licensing for international telecommunications facilities and services, submarine cables, 
and advising and making recommendations to the Commission on foreign ownership issues.  The Office 
of International Affairs will also have responsibility for all intergovernmental leadership, negotiation, and 
representational functions.  The Office of International Affairs will oversee and coordinate the FCC’s 
global participation in international organizations and multilateral conferences, regional organizations, 
cross-border negotiations, and international standard setting efforts.  The Office of International Affairs 
will also oversee bilateral meetings with other countries and foreign government officials. 
6. To further these objectives and functions, the Space Bureau and the Office of 
International Affairs will utilize professional staff from within the Commission’s current International 
Bureau as well as other parts of the Commission as needed.  
7. To accomplish this organizational change, the following actions are taken.
•The Commission will eliminate the International Bureau and generally reallocate the 
International Bureau’s authorities and functions between the Space Bureau and Office of 
International Affairs.
•The Space Bureau will consist of three divisions: the Satellite Programs and Policy Division, 
the Satellite Licensing Division, and the Earth Station Licensing Division.  These new 
divisions will have responsibilities and authorities for the analysis and functions currently 
housed within the Satellite Division of the International Bureau, including its branches, the 
Policy Branch, the Engineering Branch, and the System Analysis Branch.  
•The Office of International Affairs will consist of the Global Strategy and Negotiation 
Division and the Telecommunications and Analysis Division.  The Global Strategy and 
Negotiation Division will be moved to the Office of International Affairs from the 
International Bureau as currently organized, including each of its existing Branches and will 
maintain its current responsibilities and authorities.1  Similarly, the Telecommunications and 
Analysis Division will be moved to the Office of International Affairs from the International 
Bureau as currently organized and will maintain its current responsibilities and authorities.
1 The branches of the International Bureau Global Strategy and Negotiation Division include the International 
Radiocommunication Branch, the Cross Border Negotiations and Treaty Compliance Branch, and the Multilateral 
and Regional Affairs Branch.
609Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
•The International Bureau’s front office staff, including management and administrative staff 
within the front office, will be reassigned to the Space Bureau or the Office of International 
Affairs depending upon their roles and responsibilities.  
8. Furthermore, to implement these changes, we delegate the authority to the Space Bureau 
and the Office of International Affairs to make any necessary edits and updates to the Commission’s rules 
and any forms, policies, web addresses, systems, or other documents associated with the International 
Bureau to ensure all relevant references and procedures are updated consistent with the provisions of this 
Order, including any changes needed for renaming the International Bureau Filing System (IBFS) to the 
International Communications Filing System (ICFS).  Any previous delegation to the International 
Bureau also is transferred to the Satellite Bureau and/or the Office of International Affairs, as 
appropriate.2
B. Reorganization of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau and the Office 
of Managing Director
9. The key objectives of this reorganization are to strengthen the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the Commission’s operations and management of prominent public-facing functions as well 
as vital internal information management operations.  
1. Transfer the Reference Information Center to the Office of the Secretary
10. The RIC serves as the FCC custodian for designated public records, with functions 
including intake of records, file maintenance, reference services, retrieval of records, and retirement or 
archiving of files in accordance with record retention schedules approved by the National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA).  The RIC is also currently responsible for managing the Commission’s 
Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) and scanning and uploading documents filed on paper into 
ECFS as needed. 
11. Section 0.11 of the Commission’s Rules instructs OMD to “direct agency efforts to 
improve management effectiveness, operational efficiency, employee productivity, and service to the 
public.”3  Pursuant to Section 0.11(b), the Secretary of the Commission is designated the “official 
custodian of the Commission’s documents.”4  The Office of the Secretary in OMD oversees prompt and 
orderly processing of all matters presented to the Commission and supports the Commission decision-
making process to ensure efficient operations.  To preserve the integrity of the Commission’s records, the 
Office of the Secretary supervises the receipt and distribution of documents filed by the public through 
electronic and paper filing systems.  In addition, the Office of the Secretary gives effective legal notice of 
Commission decisions by publishing them in the Federal Register and the FCC Record.  The Secretary 
serves as legal custodian of the Commission’s official records and publishes official documents to the 
agency’s website.  
12. After this reorganization, the Office of the Secretary will be responsible for the 
management of ECFS in addition to the document custodial functions it performs today.  Since the Office 
of the Secretary currently manages both electronic documents (EDOCS) and the Electronic Commission’s 
Lifecycle Agenda Tracking System (ECLAS), the addition of ECFS to its list of responsibilities will 
create further efficiencies in the management and planning of these important internal and public facing 
systems.
13. In addition to giving it responsibility over ECFS, we transfer administration and 
management of the RIC from CGB to the Office of the Secretary.  By taking this action, we locate the 
2 See e.g., Use of Spectrum Bands Above 24 GHz, Report and Order and FNPRM, 31 FCC Rcd 8014 (2016);

610Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
Commission’s public records reference functions with the internal organization that currently carries out 
other reference functions, including management of the FCC Library.
14. We also update the Commission’s rules to reflect the revised procedures for the public to 
access the RIC.  Due to the updated security protocols associated with the FCC’s new headquarters, all 
visitors to the RIC will be required to have a scheduled appointment in advance of accessing the facility.
2. Transfer of Records Management from PERM to IT
15. In OMD, the PERM group has responsibility for the administration and implementation 
of the FCC’s agency-wide records management program, as opposed to the RIC which oversees an 
important subset of publicly available FCC records.  PERM’s records management program develops 
policies, procedures and processes to facilitate retrieval, selection, retention, and disposition of record and 
non-record materials and coordinates the records management program throughout the FCC and with 
NARA.   The FCC’s Agency Records Officer in PERM is responsible for complying with and updating 
the records schedules set by NARA. 
16. As discussed at the outset of this Order, with our actions today, we merge and relocate 
the records management program and functions into OMD’s IT group.  The IT group is currently 
responsible for providing support and services for the information technology component of records 
management.  Thus, merging the implementation and information technology components of these 
programs within the IT group will facilitate internal coordination and create additional efficiencies by 
eliminating unnecessary redundant oversight and management.  Furthermore, integrating records 
management considerations into the development and implementation of the FCC’s information systems 
will facilitate the records retention and disposal process, and strengthen compliance with records 
schedules.
17. As a result of this transfer, PERM will be renamed as the Performance and Program 
Management (PPM) group in OMD.  The PPM group will retain all of PERM’s previous functions with 
the exception of records management as described above.
3. Establish a Stand-alone Enterprise Acquisition Center in OMD
18. To reflect the Commission’s focus on strengthening all aspects of its procurement 
process, we conclude that the proper, efficient and effective dispatch of our business will be served by 
moving the EAC staff from the OMD Front Office and establishing EAC as a stand-alone group within 
OMD dedicated to the FCC’s procurement activities.  By establishing this group as a stand-alone entity, it 
is the Commission’s objective to continue to improve efficiencies, independence, accountability and 
performance in the management of its acquisition strategy, planning and procurement activities.  
C. Other Rule Changes
19. In addition to the changes otherwise identified herein, we update the Commission’s rules 
by replacing the references to the agency’s Chairman with references instead to the Chairperson 
throughout and revise other rules that refer to “chairman” to instead specify “chairperson.”5
20. We also make minor modifications to reflect slight changes to procedures related to 
Privacy Act requests,6 to update rule 0.460 concerning requests for inspection and copies of records which 
are routinely available for public inspection to reflect current procedures, and to remove from the Code of 
Federal Regulations a display of approved information collections that is no longer updated and has 
become obsolete.  We also eliminate certain Notes to rules and instead move the language from the Note 
into a subsection of the relevant rule to conform to the publishing conventions of the National Archives 
5 This change is consistent with 1 U.S.C. § 1, which provides that, with respect to statutory provisions, “words 
importing the masculine gender include the feminine as well.”  
6 The FCC is updating the points of contact for Privacy Act related inquiries listed in 47 CFR § 0.558.

III. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
21. Authority for the adoption of the foregoing reorganization is contained in Sections 4(i), 
4(j), 5(b), 5(c), and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §154(i), 154(j), 
155(b), 155(c), and 303(r). 
22. The notice and comment and effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedure 
Act contained in 5 U.S.C. §§ 553(b) and (d) do not apply either because the amendments adopted herein 
pertain to agency organization, procedure, and practice 8 or because there is “good cause” to conclude 
that notice and comment and delayed effectiveness are unnecessary for non-substantive, editorial 
revisions.9   For the same reason, no Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is required under the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. § 604.
23. This document does not contain new or modified information collection requirements 
subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13.  In addition, therefore, it does not 
contain any new or modified information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 
25 employees, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198 see 44 
U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4).
24. The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, concurs that these rules are non-major under the 
Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 804(2).   The Commission will send a copy of this Order to 
Congress and the Government Accountability office, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A).
25. Consistent with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022,10 this reorganization will not 
become effective until the appropriate clearance has been obtained, and the Order has thereafter been 
published in the Federal Register. 
D. ORDERING CLAUSES
26. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED THAT, pursuant to sections  4, 5(b), 5(c), and 303(r) of 
the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 154, 155(b), 155(c), 303(r), this Order IS 
ADOPTED.
27. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Parts 0, 1, 25, 27, 43, 63, 73, 90, 97, and 101 of the 
Commission rules ARE AMENDED as set forth in the Appendix.
28. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this Order WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE on the date 
this Order is published in the Federal Register following the appropriate clearance in accordance with 
paragraph 25.
29.IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that pursuant to section 801(a)(1)(A) of the 
Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A), the Commission SHALL SEND a copy of this 
Order to Congress and to the Government Accountability Office.

paragraph (a); 47 CFR § 63.22, Note 2; 47 CFR § 73.702, Note to paragraph (d) and Note 4.
8 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(A); 553(d) (required publication 30 days before effective date applies only to substantive 
rule). 
9 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(3)(B); 553(d) (required publication 30 days before effective date does not apply if the agency 
finds “good cause” to dispense with the requirement).  Given the non-substantive, editorial nature of certain 
revisions, and to expedite revision of the rules for the benefit of the public, we find good cause to make these rule 
revisions effective upon publication in the Federal Register.

* * * * *
49. Amend § 1.1202 to read as follows:
633Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
§ 1.1202  Definitions.
For the purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply: 
(a) Presentation.  A communication directed to the merits or outcome of a proceeding, including any 
attachments to a written communication or documents shown in connection with an oral presentation 
directed to the merits or outcome of a proceeding. Excluded from this term are communications which are 
inadvertently or casually made, inquiries concerning compliance with procedural requirements if the 
procedural matter is not an area of controversy in the proceeding, statements made by decisionmakers that 
are limited to providing publicly available information about pending proceedings, and inquiries relating 
solely to the status of a proceeding, including inquiries as to the approximate time that action in a 
proceeding may be taken. However, a status inquiry which states or implies a view as to the merits or 
outcome of the proceeding or a preference for a particular party, which states why timing is important to a 
particular party or indicates a view as to the date by which a proceeding should be resolved, or which 
otherwise is intended to address the merits or outcome or to influence the timing of a proceeding is a 
presentation.  A communication expressing concern about administrative delay or expressing concern that 
a proceeding be resolved expeditiously will be treated as a permissible status inquiry so long as no reason 
is given as to why the proceeding should be expedited other than the need to resolve administrative delay, 
no view is expressed as to the merits or outcome of the proceeding, and no view is expressed as to a date 
by which the proceeding should be resolved. A presentation by a party in a restricted proceeding not 
designated for hearing requesting action by a particular date or giving reasons that a proceeding should be 
expedited other than the need to avoid administrative delay (and responsive presentations by other parties) 
may be made on an ex parte basis subject to the provisions of § 1.1204(a)(11).
(b) Ex parte presentation.  Any presentation which: 
(1) If written (including electronic submissions transmitted in the form of texts, such as for Internet 
electronic mail), is not served on the parties to the proceeding; or 
(2) If oral, is made without advance notice to the parties and without opportunity for them to be present. 
(c) Decision-making personnel.  Any member, officer, or employee of the Commission, or, in the case of 
a Joint Board, its members or their staffs, who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved in 
formulating a decision, rule, or order in a proceeding. Any person who has been made a party to a 
proceeding or who otherwise has been excluded from the decisional process shall not be treated as a 
decision-maker with respect to that proceeding. Thus, any person designated as part of a separate trial 
staff shall not be considered a decision-making person in the designated proceeding. Unseparated Bureau 
or Office staff shall be considered decision-making personnel with respect to decisions, rules, and orders 
in which their Bureau or Office participates in enacting, preparing, or reviewing. Commission staff 
serving as the case manager in a hearing proceeding in which the Commission is the presiding officer 
shall be considered decision-making personnel with respect to that hearing proceeding. 
(d) Party.  Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the following persons are parties: 
(1)(i) In a proceeding not designated for hearing, any person who files an application, waiver request, 
petition, motion, request for a declaratory ruling, or other filing seeking affirmative relief (including a 
Freedom of Information Act request), and any person (other than an individual viewer or listener filing 
comments regarding a pending broadcast application or members of Congress or their staffs or branches 
of the federal government or their staffs) filing a written submission referencing and regarding such 
pending filing which is served on the filer, or, in the case of an application, any person filing a mutually 
exclusive application; 
634Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
(ii) Persons who file mutually exclusive applications for services that the Commission has announced will 
be subject to competitive bidding or lotteries shall not be deemed parties with respect to each others' 
applications merely because their applications are mutually exclusive. Therefore, such applicants may 
make presentations to the Commission about their own applications provided that no one has become a 
party with respect to their application by other means, e.g., by filing a petition or other opposition against 
the applicant or an associated waiver request, if the petition or opposition has been served on the 
applicant.
(iii) Individual listeners or viewers submitting comments regarding a pending broadcast application 
pursuant to § 1.1204(a)(8) will not become parties simply by service of the comments. The Media Bureau 
may, in its discretion, make such a commenter a party, if doing so would be conducive to the 
Commission's consideration of the application or would otherwise be appropriate.
(2) Any person who files a complaint or request to revoke a license or other authorization or for an order 
to show cause which shows that the complainant has served it on the subject of the complaint or which is 
a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and § 1.721 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either §§ 6.21 
or 7.21 of this chapter, and the person who is the subject of such a complaint or request that shows service 
or is a formal complaint under 47 U.S.C. 208 and § 1.721 of this chapter or 47 U.S.C. 255 and either §§ 
6.21 or 7.21 of this chapter; 
(3) The subject of an order to show cause, hearing designation order, notice of apparent liability, or 
similar notice or order, or petition for such notice or order; 
(4) In a proceeding designated for hearing, any person who has been given formal party status; and 
(5) In an informal rulemaking proceeding conducted under section 553 of the Administrative Procedure 
Act (other than a proceeding for the allotment of a broadcast channel) or a proceeding before a Joint 
Board or before the Commission to consider the recommendation of a Joint Board, members of the 
general public after the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking or other order as provided under § 
1.1206(a) (1) or (2). 
(6) To be deemed a party, a person must make the relevant filing with the Secretary, the relevant Bureau 
or Office, or the Commission as a whole. Written submissions made only to the Chairperson or individual 
Commissioners will not confer party status.
(7) The fact that a person is deemed a party for purposes of this subpart does not constitute a 
determination that such person has satisfied any other legal or procedural requirements, such as the 
operative requirements for petitions to deny or requirements as to timeliness. Nor does it constitute a 
determination that such person has any other procedural rights, such as the right to intervene in hearing 
proceedings. The Commission or the staff may also determine in particular instances that persons who 
qualify as “parties” under § 1.1202(d) should nevertheless not be deemed parties for purposes of this 
subpart.
(8) A member of Congress or his or her staff, or other agencies or branches of the federal government or 
their staffs will not become a party by service of a written submission regarding a pending proceeding 
that has not been designated for hearing unless the submission affirmatively seeks and warrants grant of 
party status.
(e) Matter designated for hearing.  Any matter that has been designated for hearing before a presiding 
officer.

address indicated in 47 CFR 0.401(a). Copies of the petitions and related pleadings will be available for

approved by the FCC, unless the application is determined to be fee-exempt. We determine your official 
filing date based on one of the following situations: 
(1) You file your Satellite Space Station Application or your Application for Earth Stations to Access a 
Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized to provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies 
in the United States in ICFS.
Your official filing date is the date and time (to the millisecond) you file your application and receive a 
confirmation of filing and submission ID. 
(2) You file all other applications in ICFS and then do one of the following:
Your official filing date is: 
(i) Pay by online Automatic Clearing House (ACH) payment, online Visa, MasterCard, American 
Express, or Discover credit card payment, or wire transfer payment denominated in U.S. dollars and 
drawn on a United States financial institution and made payable to the Federal Communications 
Commission (through ICFS)
The date your online payment is approved. (Note: You will receive a remittance ID and an authorization 
number if your transaction is successful). 
(ii) Determine your application type is fee-exempt or your application qualifies for exemption to charges 
as provided in this part
The date you file in ICFS and receive a confirmation of filing and submission ID.
Application.   A request for an earth or space station radio station license, an international cable landing 
license, or an international service authorization, or a request to amend a pending application or to modify 
638Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
or renew licenses or authorizations. The term also includes the other requests that may be filed in  ICFS 
such as transfers of control and assignments of license applications, earth station registrations, and foreign 
carrier affiliation notifications. 
Authorizations.   Generally, a written document or oral statement issued by us giving authority to operate 
or provide service. 
International Communications Filing System-  The International  Communications Filing System (ICFS) 
is a database, application filing system, and processing system for all International and Satellite services.

DARS) and an Application for an Earth Station to Access a Non-U.S. Satellite Not Currently Authorized 
to Provide the Proposed Service in the Proposed Frequencies in the United States officially filed the 
moment you file them through  ICFS. The system tracks the date and time of filing (to the millisecond). 
For purposes of the queue discussed in § 25.158 of this chapter, we will base the order of the applications 
in the queue on the date and time the applications are filed, rather than the “Official Filing Date” as 
defined here. 
Satellite Services.   All satellite services authorized under part 25 of this chapter. 
Submission ID.   The Submission ID is the confirmation number you receive from  ICFS once you have

* * * * *
(a) * * * Six months prior to the start of each season, licensees and permittees shall by informal written 
request, submitted to the Commission electronically in the International Communications Filing System 
(ICFS), indicate for the season the frequency or frequencies desired for transmission to each zone or area 
of reception specified in the license or permit, the specific hours during which it desires to transmit to 
such zones or areas on each frequency, and the power, antenna gain, and antenna bearing it desires to use. 
* * *
(b) * * * After receipt of such notification, the licensee or permittee shall, in writing, not later than two 
months before the start of the season in question, electronically inform the Commission in ICFS either 
that it plans to operate in accordance with the authorization which the Commission intends to issue, or 
that it plans to operate in another manner. * * *
(c) If after submitting the request required under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, but before 
receipt of the Commission’s notification referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the licensee or 
permittee submits a request for changes of its original request electronically in ICFS such requests will be 
accepted for consideration only if accompanied by statements showing good cause therefor and will be 
honored only if conditions permit. * * * If after the licensee or permittee submits the information required 
under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, but before the start of the season in question, the 
licensee or permittee submits electronically in ICFS a request for changes in its manner of operation for 
the season in question, the request will be accepted for consideration only if accompanied by statements 
showing good cause therefor and will be honored only if conditions permit. * * *
* * * * *
(d) The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of the section shall apply to licensees, to permittees 
operating under program test authority, and to permittees who anticipate applying for and receiving 
program test authority for operation during the specified season. Permittees who during the process of 
construction wish to engage in equipment tests shall by informal written request, submitted to the 
Commission electronically in ICFS not less than 30 days before they desire to begin such testing, indicate 
the frequencies they desire to use for testing and the hours they desire to use those frequencies. No 
equipment testing shall occur until the Commission has authorized frequencies and hours for such testing. 
Such authorizations shall be only for one season, and if it is desired to continue equipment testing in a 
following season, new requests for frequencies and hours must be submitted at least 30 days before it is 
desired to begin testing in the following season. 
(e) Within 14 days after the end of each season, a report shall be filed with the Commission electronically 
in ICFS by each licensee or permittee operating under program test authority who has been issued a 
seasonal schedule for that season. * * *
* * * * *

electronically in ICFS to ensure compliance with these restrictions. * * *
665Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-1
* * * * *
(i) * * *
(1) Requests for frequency-hours shall be accompanied by all pertinent technical data with reference to 
the frequencies and hours of operation, including calculated field strengths delivered to the zones or 
areas of reception.
(2) It is preferable that calculated field strengths delivered to zones or areas of reception be equal to or 
greater than those required by I.F.R.B. Technical Standards, Series A (and supplements thereto), in 
order for the I.F.R.B. to afford the notified assignment protection from interference. Nevertheless, 
calculated field strengths less than those required by the I.F.R.B. standards for protection will be 
acceptable to the Commission. However, licensees should note that if such lesser field strengths are 
submitted no protection from interference will be provided by the I.F.R.B. if their technical 
examination of such notifications show incompatibilities with other notified assignments fully 
complying with I.F.R.B. technical standards.
(3) Licensees are permitted to engage in multiple operation as defined in § 73.701(d).
(4) Seasonal requests for frequency-hours will be only for transmissions to zones or areas of reception 
specified in the basic instrument of authorization. Changes in such zones or areas will be made only 
on separate application for modification of such instruments made electronically in ICFS.
(j) Not more than one frequency will be assigned for use at any one time for any one program 
transmission except in instances where a program is intended for reception in more than one zone or area 
of reception and the intended zones or areas cannot be served by a single frequency: Provided, however, 
That on a showing of good cause made electronically in ICFS a licensee may be authorized to operate on 
more than one frequency at any one time to transmit any one program to a single zone or area of 
reception. 
* * * * *
(m) * * * If for a forthcoming season the total of the requests for daily frequency-hours of all licensees 
exceeds 100, all licensees will be notified and each licensee that makes an adequate showing 
electronically in ICFS that good cause exists for not having its requested number of frequency-hours 
reduced and that operation of its station without such reduction would be consistent with the public 
interest may be authorized the frequency-hours requested. 
* * * * *
140. Amend § 73.713 by revising the second sentence of paragraph (a) to read as follows:
§ 73.713 Program tests.

International Communications Filing System (ICFS), is required for any of the following changes: 
* * * * *
(g) Other changes, not specified above in this section, may be made at any time without the authority of

schedule or to continue operating for a temporary period of more than 10 days, the station may not limit 
or discontinue operation until it requests and receives specific authority to do so from the FCC by 
electronic filing in ICFS. When the station subsequently resumes regular operation after such limited 
operation or discontinuance of operation, it shall notify the FCC in Washington, DC by electronic filing

NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILIT Y FOR FORFEITURE  AND ORDER

By the Commission:  
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
1. Congress established t he Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Progr am to provide 
assistance to American families by allowing  eligible low -income households to receive discounts  for 
broadband service  and certain connected devices and reimbursing participating providers for providing 
such discounts.  To ensure the integrity and effective ness of the EBB Program, Congress and the Federal 
Communica tions Commission (Commission) imposed several restrictions and requirements on 
participating providers.  Among other things, reimbursement claims for connected devices are limited to 
the market value for the provided device  less a required co -pay.  The Com mission takes seriously its 
obligation to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs it administers.  As we endeavor to clos e the 
digital divide for low -income Americans through programs like the EBB Program, we are mindful we 
must ensure  against disb ursing funds to participating providers that seek to obtain the benefit of these 
limited resources without abiding by the Commiss ion’s rules.   
2. In this Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL), w e propose a penalty of $62,000,000 against  
Q Link Wireless LLC (Q L ink or Company ) for apparently violating provisions of the 202 1 Consolidated 
Appropriations Act  and Commission rules and orders governing the reimbursement s it claimed for 
providing E BB Program customers with internet -connected  devices  between December  2021 and March  
2022 .  Because of these  apparent violations , which involved  overclaiming support  for hundreds of 
thousands  of computer tablets , Q Link apparently obtained at least $20,792,800  in improper 
disbursements from the EBB P rogram  during the period und er review .  For these reasons, and in light o f 
the scope, duration , and seriousness of Q Link’s apparent violations and the need to promote compliance 
with the rules, we propose the penalty de tailed in this Notice of Appare nt Liability for Forfeiture  and 
Order . 
II. BACKGROUND  
A. Legal Framework  
3. Established by Congress on December 27, 2020 , pursuant to the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2021  (Act) , the $3.2 billion Emergency Broadband Connectivity Fund (Fund) 
provided resources for the Co mmission to establish the EBB Program to provide  discounts on  broadband 
internet service and certain internet -connected devices to eligible low-income households, including those 
experiencing COVID -19-related economic disruptions.1  The Act and t he Commission’s rules 
 
1 See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 116 -260, div. N, tit. IX, § 904 , 134 Stat. 1182 , 2129 -63 
(2020)  (prior to 2021 amendment by Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117 -58 (2021)  (codified at 
(continued…)  
677 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23-2 
 implementing the EBB Program authorize d reimbursement from the Fund to participating  provider s who 
gave such discounts.    
4. In the rules govern ing the EBB  Program , the Commission stated that , to receive 
reimbursement, an officer of the  participating provider must certify  that “the connected devi ce claimed 
meets the Commission’s  requirements, that the reimbursement claim amount reflects the market value of 
the device, and that the connected device has been delivered  to the household. ”2  The Commission’s 
stated purpose was to extend the life of the Fund by making the reimbursement claim amount reflect no 
more than the market value of the device.3  The Commission further directed participating providers to 
retain any materials that  
document  compliance with these requirements, including the device  type ( e.g., laptop, 
tablet, mobile hotspot, modem, gateway, router, antenna, receiver, or satellite dish) and 
device make and model.  We find that requiring certifications under penalty of perjury 
along with the possibility of an audit will help to encour age compliance with EBB 
Program requirements and reduce the incidence of improper payments.4  
B. Factual Background  
5. Q Link Wireless  LLC.   Q Link is a limited liability company organized in Delaware and 
based in Dania Beach, Florida .5  Q Link is an eligible telecommunications carrier  (ETC) that has provided 
wireless Lifeline service on a resale basis  since 2012,6 operating in 31 states , Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
Virgin Islands .7  As an ETC, Q Link elected  to participate in the EBB Program8 and offered EBB

III. DISCUSSION  
8. The EBB Program sought  to reduce the monetary burden of broadband internet access 
service for low-income househo lds during  the COVID -19 health emergency .  At the EBB Program’s end, 
over nine million American households benefited from  subsidies for broadband services and devices ,20 
including students accessing virtual classrooms, adults working remotely , and people pr oviding and 
receiving critical healthcare services.21  However, while the Act and the Commission’s rules made it 
possible for approved EBB providers to be reimbursed  for providing EBB  connected  devices to eligible 
households,22 providers  were restrict ed to device subsidies that reflect ed the device’s “market value .”23 
9. Congress authorized  the EBB Program to help increase broadband connectivity to 
struggling households  during the pandemic , not for companies to attempt to capitalize on a crisis by 
overcharging  taxpayers  for devices and services .24  Consistent with the Act’s direction to administer the 
EBB Program for eligible households during the C OVID -19 emer gency period while guarding against 
waste, fraud , and abuse of the Fund’s resources, the Commission adopte d limitations on the amount EBB 
providers could claim for supplying connected devices and requir ed providers to charge users a co-pay for 
each connected device .25  Providers seeking o verpayments  in violation of the rules  undermine the 
integrity  of the EBB P rogram .  We find that , by claiming reimbursements for EBB connected devices  at a 
rate apparently substantially exceeding their market value , Q Link  apparently willfully and repeatedly

10. In implementing the EBB Program, the Commission  tailored its rules to make support  
available in ac cordance with the Act’s purposes  and to safeguard the Fund  from fraud, waste, and abuse .27  
For example, to participate in the EBB Program, broadband internet service providers were authorized to 
obtain  support from the program that was “no more than the st andard rate for an internet service offering 
and associated equipment, but not more th an $50.00 per month.”28  As the Commission found, t he 
inclusion of a “standard rate” limitation was intended to prevent providers  from artificially increasing 
prices above  the usual market rate for their services for the purpose of claiming the maximum 
reimbursement amount.29  Similarly,  Congress specified that  providers could be reimbursed up to  $100.00 
for providing a connected device to a customer’s household but had to c harge the household a co -pay 
greater than $10.00 and less than $50 .00 and could receive reimbursement for only a single device per 
household.30  Importantly , to ensure the amount of reimbursement was fair , and to extend the Program 
funds for as long as poss ible, the Commission required that the claimed reimbursement for an EBB 
connected device be based on its “market value .”31 
11. As part of Q Link’s notification to the Commission of its intent  to participate in the EBB 
Program, on May 11, 2021, the Company  claim ed its 8-inch tablet had a “retail rate” of {[ ]}, the 
customer co -payment would be $10.01 , and the EBB support amount would therefore  be {[ ]}.32  By 
submitting and  certifying claims for reimbursement for connected devices each month  from  May 2021 
through M arch 2022  at a rate of {[ ]} each,33 Q Link represent ed under penalty of perjury that each of 
its connected device s had a market value of {[ ]}, comprised of the $10.01  customer co -payment it 
certified it charged  the household plus th e {[ ]} reimbursement  from the Fund .34

14. Market Value Analysis.   The term “market value” is a recognized term, both g enerally and 
in the broadband internet service industry and applicable regulatory frame work .  As both the courts and 
the Commission have long recognized, t he term refers to the price at which property would change hands 
between a willing buyer and a willin g seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and 
both having reasonab le knowledge of relevant facts.42  In competitive markets with many sellers and 
many buyers, the market price will represent market value.  The Commission has previously set the 
baseline for a good faith determination of fair market value by requiring carriers to use methods that are 
routinely used by the general business community.43  Where, as here, a product is not sold through retail 
channels, one cannot look to its ret ail price.  Instead, we look to the retail prices of products that have  
identical or similar  technical specifications .

 obtain information from Q Link’s equipment supplier, Hot Pepper, Inc., in response to a sub poena, during 
the course of its investigation.   
16. To determine whether Q Link accurately represented the market value of the Scepter 8
tablet in its EBB device claims as required by section 54.1608(e)(8) of our  rules, we must examin e 
whether {[ ]} is the market  value  of the tablet Q Link provided  during 2021  until March 2022 .  
Because the Scepter 8  tablet does not appear to have been available at retail and may, in fact, have only 
been available  through Q Link, there is no retail price for the device  to reference as a potential market 
value .  Therefore, the market value must be determined by compari ng the Scepter 8 tablet’s specifications 
with other widely  available devices with similar specifications and characteristics and established retail 
prices.45  Accordingly , we conducted an anal ysis of the market value of the Scepter 8 tablet pursuant to 
the following , four-part process: (1) identifying device characteristics that are likely related to market 
value ; (2) assess ing whether the devices submitted by Q  Link as purportedly comparable to the Scepter 8 
are, in fact, comparable for purposes of assessing market value; if not,  (3) identify ing other widely 
available devices  having characteristics similar to various specifica tions of the Scepter 8 ; (4) establi shing 
price ranges based on devices that have characteristics similar to those of the Scepter 8 ; and (5) 
determining which devices had the most similar  technical characteristics , and using those prices to 
determine a mark et value .46 
17. Device specifications typically considered by consumers in selecting a device include:
screen size, processor speed and number of cores, memory (RAM), storage (ROM), battery capacity, and 
camera resolution.47  Generally, improvements in each of  these specifications are associated with a higher 
retail price for the device, both because consumers are willing to pay more for higher -quality products 
and because improved specifications are more costly to manufacture.48  To assess whether the devices 
submitted by Q Link as purportedly com parable to the Scepter 8 are actually analogous,  we compared 
those specifications .  That comparison revealed:  (1) all but one of the devices Q Link claimed were 
comparable had at least double the RAM and ROM,49 and five of the seven devices had more than t riple 
the RAM; (2) while some of the devices had similar processor speeds as the Scepter 8, four of the devices 
had eight cores, which is double that of the Scepter 8; (3) all of the claimed comparable devices had larger 
batteries; (4) all but one of the d evices had significantly better camera resolution;50 and (5) some o f the 
devices had a larger screen, and the majority of the devices had significantly better screen resolution.51  
Thus, the devices submitted b y Q Link had technical specifications  that were significantly superior to the 
Scepter 8, and therefore they were not sufficiently similar for purposes of determining market value.52 
18. Since we could find  no devices sold at retail  that were similar to the Sce pter 8 in all of the
technical specifications discussed above , we performed two sets of comparisons.  First, we identified 
devices that had similar RAM , ROM and camera quality, and then we identified devices with 8 -inch 
45 In its submissions to USAC to substantiate market value  and support its ce rtifications , Q Link used this same 
methodology of relying on the online retail price of purport edly comparable devices to determine market value .  See 
email from Issa Asad to Zac St. Martin (Nov. 16, 2021) (attaching “comparisons” in the form of a series of 
screenshots of other tablet devices available online and claiming 
]}). 
46 See Attachment 2, “Analysis  of Market Value ,” at para. 4. 
47 Id. at para. 5.  
48 Id. 
49 The remaining “comparable ,” although having the same amount of ROM as the Scepter 8, has twice as much 
RAM and a much larger screen o f 13 inches, compared to the 8 -inch screen of the Scepter 8.    
50 While that one device has a comparable camera, it is significantly bette r than the Scepter 8 in all other respects .

 screens  and somewhat similar process or speeds .  Those tablets with similar R AM, ROM, and camera 
quality had only 7 -inch screens and lower batter y capacit ies, and some had slightly lower clock speeds.53  
Looking at devices with 8 -inch screens and processors with clock speeds reasonably similar to those of 
the Scepter 8 , they also had other specifications  that were significantly superior to the Scepter 8.  For 
example, all the devices had twice the ROM and all but one had twice the RAM as the Scepter 8 ; all had 
cameras with mor e than twice the resolution of the cameras included with the Scepte r 8; and all but one of 
the devices had larger batteries than the Scepter 8.54   
19. We then closely examined the devices we had identified to determine a subset of devices 
that were “closest” to the Scepter 8 in terms of the selected specifications .  Among the  7-inch devices, the 
two devices that were most similar to the Scepter 8 in terms of  the technical specifications we examined  
were the Hyundai HyTab 7WC1, which had a price of $50 to $60 d uring the relevant period, and the 
Amazon Fire 7, which had a price of $65 ($50 with an ad -supported lock screen).  Based on the price s of 
these devices, we find a reasonable floor for the market value of the Scepter 8 would be $50 . 
20. Among the devices with an 8-inch screen, the device most similar to the Scepter 8 in 
terms of the technical specifications we examined was the Hyundai HyTab 8WC1, which sold for $70 
during the relevant period.  It had the same processor and RAM as the Scepter 8, but twice the RO M, a 
slightly faster processor speed and a better camera.  Given tha t it has several technical specifications  that 
are superior to the Scepter 8, we find that the market value of the Scepter 8 must be less than $70.55   
21. Based on our examination of devices  with similar technical specifications , in this 
particular case, our b est determination of the market value of the Scepter 8 is $60.00, which is the mid -
point in the range of prices of the devices we found most comparable.  Several factors support t his 
conclusion and suggest that the market value of the Scepter 8 should tend  towards the low end of the 
market.  First, the Scepter 8, unlike the Amazon Fire, is not a brand name tablet, and name brand products 
generally command higher prices as they may signal higher quality components to consumers.  Second, 
the Scepter 8 does no t appear to have been sold anywhere at retail.  Third, while customer reviews of the 
Scepter 8 are limited, the reviews on YouTube and reseller websites were largely negative as t o the 
quality of the device.56  Relatedly , the PassMark Android device benchma rking app ranks the Scepter 8 
device 4,3 58th out of 4,400 tablet and smartphone devices , which puts it in the bottom 2 percent in terms 
of benchmark scores.57   
22. Finally, as we ha ve noted, two somewhat similar devices with 8 -inch screens – the 
Hyundai 8WC1 , with a better camera, double the ROM and a higher capacity battery ; and the Gateway 
8", with more RAM  and more ROM – sold for only $70 .00 and $65.00, respectively, during the relevant 
period .  If one deducts from the $70.00 price of the Hyundai 8WC1  the li kely incremental value of the 
increased ROM, the better camera and the larger capacity battery, which together likely well exceed 
$10.00, the retail price of such a device would be below $60 .00.  Likewise, a similar exercise for the 
 
53 Id. at para s. 12-13 and Table 2 .   
54 Id. at para. 15 and Table 3.  
55 Specifically, we observe that tablets with better features generally command higher retail prices than their 
otherwise identical counterparts. For example, the Hyundai 8WB1 has 1 GB of additional RAM and 3MP of 
additional camera resolution compared to the Hyundai 8WC1 and costs $10 more. The Fire 7 ” with 32 GB of ROM 
costs $20 more than an identical Fire 7” tablet with 16GB of ROM .

 Gateway 8" would reveal  a retail price well below $60.00.  For these reasons, we find that the market 
value of the Scepter 8 is , at most , $60.00.   
23. Thus , Q Link’ s assertion that the Scepter 8 has a market value of {[ ]} is not 
supported by the information provided by the C ompany , nor is it supported by analyzing comparable 
devices available during the same time frame .  As a result, apparent ly Q Link has been  reimbursed 
substantially in excess of the Scepter 8’s objective market value .  We find that Q Link has apparently 
received an overpayment of at least  {[ ]} per device for each of the {[ ]} connected devices 
for which it claimed reimbursemen t during the EBB Program . 
24. Q Link had access to the same information we use in this analysis .  Thus,  Q Link  knew or  
should have known the market value of its device was  far less than it claimed when it sought 
reimbursement , and that t he technical specifications of the  Company’s  device were  substantially  inferior 
to those that Q Link asserted were comparable .  Despite this, the Company falsely stated in  its election 
notice  that the market value of the device was {[ ]}.58  Further more , Q Link ’s Chief Executive 
Officer  certified with each monthly claim for reimbursement during the  entire EBB Program that the 
amount Q Link claimed reflected the market value of the device ,59 and he certified that the information 
contained in each claim was true, complete, and accurate to the best of his knowledge, information, and 
belief .60  From May 2021 through March 2022, Q Link sought reimburs ement from the Fund for devices 
at a rate substantially in excess of  their market value , falsely certified as to their market value , and 
claim ed amounts from the Fund  again substantially in excess of  those to which it was entitled under the 
rules .  
25. In corr espondence with USAC in November 2021 , Q Link claimed that its EBB connected  
device and the reimbursement rate had been approved  by USAC .61  To the contrary, t he Commission did not 
authorize USAC to pre -approve any EBB connected device market values .  Signi ficantly , in the EBB 
rulemaking, the Commission rejected requests from commenters who advocated to pre -approve the retail 
value of connected devices.62  Inste ad, the Commission sa id it would forego a pre -approval process for 
policy reasons and would  use bac k-end audits to keep participants honest  about claiming reimbursement for 
only the market value of devices : 
to ensure the quick reimbursement of valid claims  for connected devices, USAC will not 
be required collect and review documentation before processin g a reimbursement claim.  
Instead, we require providers, under penalty of perjury, to certify that the connected 
device meets the Commission’s requirements, that the reimbursement claim amount 
reflects the market value of the device, that the household has  been charged a compliant 
co-pay amount, and that the connected device has been delivered to the household.63   
Consequently , USAC did not “approve” Q Link’s  reimbursement rate for EBB connected devices.

 26.   In light of our rejection of Q Link’s assertion s in its LOI responses, its EBB election 
materials, monthly certifications that its connected device had a market value of {[ ]}, and the other  
information assembled in the Bureau’s investigation , including  the economic analysis of Q Link’s device,  
we fi nd that Q Link apparently violated section 904(b)(5) of the Act as well  as sections 54.1603(b), 
54.1608(d), and 54.1608(e)(8) of the Commission’s rules by certifying and claiming connected devices at 
a rate that apparently substantially exceeded their mark et value and thus exceed ed the amount of 
reimbursement permitted under the EBB Program .64  Specifically, the {[ ]} per device 
reimbursement amount claimed by Q Link added  to the $10.01  co-pay the Company reportedly charged 
device recipients  result ed in the {[ ]} per device market value asserted by the Company .  However, 
as explained above,  the market value for the Scepter 8 tablet is  at most  $60.00 .  Thus, the  maximum per 
device reimbursement allowable under the Commission’s rules was $49.99 (the market value of $60.00, 
minus the $10.01  co-pay).  As a result , we find  that Q Link apparently received an approximate 
overpayment of approximately  $50 per device for {[ ]} devices  between May 12, 2021 and March 
15, 2022 .  Thus, Q Link apparently claimed and received overpayments from the Fund  of approxim ately 
$32,900,700.00  over the course of the EBB Program.  F ocusing on the months at issue in the Bureau’s 
investigation, we find Q Link apparently claimed excessive reimbursements for {[ ]} EBB  
connected devices between December  16, 2021 and March 15,  2022, for an overcollection from  the Fund 
of at least $20,792,800 .00.

27. Section 503(b) of the  Communications Act of 1934  (Communications Act) authorizes  the 
Commission to impose a forfeiture against any entity that “willfully or repeatedly fail[s] to comply with 
any of the provisions of [the Communications  Act] or of any rule, regulation, or order issued by the 
Commission [.]”65  Here, section 50 3(b)(2) (B) of the Communications  Act authorizes us to assess a 
forfeiture against Q Link  of up to $ 237,268 .00 for each day of a continuing violation, up to a statutory 
maximum of $ 2,372,677 .00 for a single act or failure to act.66  In exercising our forfei ture authori ty, we 
must consider the “nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the 
violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as 
justice may require.”67  In addition , the Commission has established forfeiture guidelines; they establish 
base penalties for certain violations and identify criteria that we consider when determining the 
appropriate penalty in any given case.68  Under these guidelines, we may a djust a forfei ture upward for 
violations that are egregious, intentional, or repeated, or that cause substantial harm or generate 
substantial economic gain for the violator.69   
28. In this case , Q Link apparently claimed reimbursement  from the EBB Program  
substantially  in excess of the market value of its connected devices each month from December 16, 2021  to 
March 15, 2022, thereby preventing those funds from assisting other eligible households.  Based on our 
analysis of the  connected  device’s technical specifications and r etail prices of comparable devices that were

66 See 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)( 2)(B); 47 CFR § 1.80(b)( 2).  These amounts reflect the inflationary adjustments to the  
forfeitures specified in section 503(b) of the Communications  Act.  See Amendment of Section 1.80(b) of the 
Commission’s Rules, Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inf lation , Order, DA 22-1356 , 202 2 WL

 widely available at the time, we have concluded Q Link’s claims requested approximately {[ ]} more 
than market value per device .  During the  period  relevant to our inves tigation , Q Link claimed excessive 
reimb ursement for  {[ ]} EBB connected devices  for an apparent total overcollection from the Fund 
of approximately $20,792,800 .00.  We consider each device Q Link claimed and certified for 
reimbursement above market value as a separate violation ; therefore , Q Link had a total of {[ ]} 
violations of section 904(b)(5) of the Act and sections 54.1603(b), 54.1608(d), and 54.1608(e)(8).70 
29. Because the EBB Program rules are new, n either the Commission’s forfeitu re guidelines 
nor its case law have establishe d a base forfeiture for violations of  rules governing claims for EBB 
connected devices.   Based on the totality of the circumstances in this case, including consideration of the 
factors set forth in section 503( b)(2)(E) of the Communications Act, we determine  that a forfeiture 
amount based on treble the harm to the Fund is appropriate .  The Commission has previously proposed 
forfeitures based, in part, on three times the amount of improper reimbursements for monthly Lifeline 
service to customers from the Unive rsal Service Fund ,71 as well as in the context of a company’s failure to 
pay reg ulatory fees.72  Every dollar misdirected from the EBB  Program to provide rs that violate our rules 
is a dollar that could instead have been used to make broadband service more af fordable for low -income 
Americans , and w e consider the proposed approach  to be  appropriate  to both penalize Q Link ’s violations 
of the EBB Program rules  and to  deter those broadband service providers that fail to devote sufficient 
resources to prevent  comp any practices resulting in overcollection violations , such as inflating the am ount 
claimed for connected devices above market value . Although we reserve for a separate action a final 
determination of exact amount of Q Link’s apparent overcollection from th e Fund, as discussed above, Q 
Link apparently claimed at least {[ ]} per device  above  the amount to which it was entitled . 
30. Therefore, we propose a forfeiture penalty of $62,000,000.00 against Q Link for the 
apparent violations of section 904(b)(5) of the  Act and sections 54.1603(b), 54.1608(d), and 
54.1608(e)(8).73  If an EBB service provider violates our rules and submits a request for program  support 
that it knew or should have known exceeds the market value of its connected devices, and thus requests 
and/or receives more reimbursement from the Fund than the amount to wh ich it is properly entitled, it 
undermines the support reimbursement mechanism.  The Commission believes that the imposition of a 
significant forfeiture amount upon Q Link is a necessary r esponse to overcollection violations , 
particularly in programs that benefit households in need of support for telecommunications and 
broadband service and devices .  Service providers participating in these programs  must take care to 
ensure compliance with the Commission ’s rules, especially the rules and procedures requirin g that 
providers request and/or receive federal support only in the amount s permitted under the rules.  
31. In addition, in light of Q Link’s apparent misconduct and the resulting harm to the F und, 
we order Q Link to respond  in writing  within 30 days of the release of this NAL explaining why the

 Commission should not initiate proceedings, pursuant to 47 CFR § 54 .1801(e)(2), to remove Q Link from 
the ACP  program, and/or proceedings against Q Link  to revoke its Commission authorizations, including 
its Section 214 authorizations.74  We also direct Q Link to respond in writing within 30 days as to why the 
Enforcemen t Bureau and the Wireline Competition Bureau should not take measures, in addition to t he 
safeguards already in place, pursuant to 47 CFR § 54.1801(e)(2)(iii)(B) to remove Q Link from the 
Commission’s list of ACP approved providers, USAC’s Companies Near M e Tool, and any similar 
records ; and/or to suspend or revoke Q Link’s ability to enroll  or transfer in new subscribers.   We direct Q 
Link to address the full range of its participation in the EBB and ACP programs, including the accuracy 
of its certificatio ns and other representations to the Commission and any other potential failures to 
comp ly with program requirements.  The Commission remains committed to maintaining service to all 
eligible customers and will work to ensure continued service.   
IV. CONCLUSION  
32. We have determined that Q Link  apparently willfully and repeatedly violated section 
904(b)(5)  of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 116 -260, div. N, tit. IX , 134 Stat. at 
2132 ,75 and section s 54.1603(b) , 54.1608(d),  and 54.1608 (e)(8)  of the Commission’s r ules.  As such, Q 
Link  is apparently liable for a forfeiture of $62,000,000.00.

ANALYSIS  OF MARKET VALUE   
 
Introduction  
1. Because neither the Scepter 8 nor an identical tablet was sold  through any major retailers during 
the EBB Program, we cannot look to the retail price as a n estimate of market value.  Instead, we 
looked to the retail prices of devices with similar specifications . 
2. Given the unusual  combination of technical specificatio ns in  the Scepter 8 , we did not  find 
directly comparable devices.  Although the Scepter 8 has an 8 -inch screen like many higher -end 
devices, it has memory (RAM), storage (ROM), and camera resolution similar to l ower -tier 
devices with a 7 -inch screen.   
Introduction And Overview of Methodology  
3. The phrase “market value ” has been defined as the price at which property would change hands 
between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell 
and both having reasonable  knowledge of relevant facts.  In competitive markets with many 
sellers and many buy ers, the interaction of supply and demand generally will determine market 
price, which will also represent market value.  Here, however, as indicated above, the Scepter 8 
was not sold through any major retailers, so one cannot look to its market price to e stimate market 
value.  
4. Our analysis proceed ed as follows:  
o First,  we identified technical specifications  that are likely related to market value.  
o Then, we analyzed the device s submitted by Q  Link as purportedly comparable to the 
Scepter 8, based on the technical specifications  that were identified  in the first step . 
o We then identified o ther widely -available devices  that had various specifications  similar 
to the Scepter 8.1  Because of the unusual mix of technical specifications in  the Scepter 8, 
we separately examined devices with 7 -inch screens and those with 8 -inch screens . 
o  Fourth, we used the retail prices of these devices to establish a market value range.  
o Fifth, we de termined which devices had the most similar specifications, and used those 
prices to determine a market value for the Scepter 8.  
Relevant Device Specifications   
5. In identifying devices to compare with the Scepter 8, we examined the following technical 
specifica tions , since these specifications  are generally advertised on retail websites and buying 
 
1 Note that this approach  is similar to that taken by Q Link, when it su bmitted data on the market prices of devices it 
claimed were similar to the Scepter 8 to justify the price it charged for the device.  However, as discussed below, the 
technical specifications  of the devices i dentified as comparable by Q Link do not appear  closely comparable to those 
of the Scepter 8.  
693 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23-2 
 guides, and they are technical specifications  typically considered b y consumers in selecting a 
device:2 
▪ Screen size  
▪ Processor speed and number of cores  
▪ Memory (RAM)  
▪ Storage (ROM)  
▪ Battery capacity  
▪ Camera Resolution  
In general,  for each of these specifications , an improvement in the specification  is associated with 
a higher retail price for the device, both because consumers are willing to pay more for higher -
quality prod ucts and because  devices with  improved technical specifications  are more costly to 
manufacture .3  For example, in comparing oth erwise identical devices, those with more RAM or 
ROM will likely have higher prices.4  Similarly, where a manufacturer sells othe rwise identical 
devices with different screen sizes, the device with the larger screen generally has a higher price.  
6. While  the analyses below incorporate specifications  that are most likely to be the best predictors 
for the market value of a device, unmeas ured or unmeasurable characteristics of a device may 
also affect market value.  For example brand name, quality of components,  overall device

device to purchase.  Best Buy,  Buying  Guide  Tablet s, https://www.bestbuy.com/site/buying -guides/tablet -buying -

3 Buying guides also highlight the relationship between price and a device’s technical specifications .  The CDW 
Tablet Buying Guide  states “the larger the capacity of the tablet, the more expensive the device ” and “as with screen 
size and storage, when memory goes up, so does the tablet's price.”  CDW,  Tablet Buying Guide  (Nov. 2, 2021),

 performance, or other unmeasured aspects of quality and reliability could be important factors in 
determining mark et value.  
7. The available evidence suggests that along many, if not all, of these less easily measured device 
characteristics, the Scepter 8 tablet would either underperform competitor products or would not 
be appreciably different.5  Consequently, the mark et value of the Scepter 8 should be expected to 
be on the low end of devices with similar technical specifications . 
8. We collec ted technical specifications  and prices of devices with similar specifications that were 
sold by major retailers.  Technical specif ications  were collected from retailer websites, 
manufacturer websites, publicly available device manuals, and FCC engineering certifications. 
For each device, where possible, multiple sources were checked.   Device prices were gathered 
using price aggregato rs and website archives spanning from a month prior to the adoption  of the 
EBB Program  rules on  February 25, 2021,  to March 15, 2022, the end of EBB program claim 
submissions to USAC.6  In particular, CamelCamelCamel is an Amazon.com price aggregator 
that provides the price history of a product listing.7  In addition, the Wayback Machine is an 
archive of websites.  While not all websites are archived, there are snapshots of retailer websites 
that provide price information on tablets that were available.8 
Evaluation of Devices Q -Link Submitted as Comparable  
9. As a starting point for the analysis, we examined the techni cal specifications  of the devices that Q 
Link submitted as comparable to the Scepter 8.9  See Table 1.  All the devices cited by Q Link are 
 
5 Although reviews for the Scepter 8 are limited,  reviews  found on YouTube and reseller websites were largely 
negative as to the quality of the device.   Similarly, the PassMark Android device benchmarking app ranks the 
Scepter 8 4358 out of 4400 tablet and smartphone devices.  This puts it in the bottom 2 percent  of benchmark scores.

$111, but both the manufacturer’s website and Amazon listed it as $90 during the EBB program.  In June of 2021, 
the Vankyo website listed the device for $89.99.  Vankyo, VANKYO MatrixPad S8 Android Tablet, Android 9.0 Pie,

Evaluation of Devices with an 8 Inch Screen  
14. As indicated in Table 3, the 8 -inch devices we identified generally had higher pr ices than the 7 -
inch devices listed in Table 2 (as one would expect), but also had other technical specifications  
that were significantly superior to the Scepter 8.  For examp le, all the devices in Table 3 had 
twice the ROM and all but one had twice the RA M as the Scepter 8.  In addition,  most  had 
cameras with more than twice the resolution of the cameras included with the Scepter 8.  Finally, 
all but one of the devices had la rger batteries than the Scepter 8.   Despite many superior technical 
specification s, the prices of all these devices were still below Q -Link’s claimed reimbursement 
rate for the Scepter 8.  Specifically, the prices of the devices in Table 3 range from $64.9 9 to 
$82.99 , which again is significantly below the market value claimed by Q -Link for the Scepter 8. 
In addition, at least two of the five devices had the same Allwinner  A100 processor that was used 
in the Scepter 8 during this period.16  These two devices had the same processor as the Scepter 8, 
but more ROM, better camera resolution,  and a larger battery capacity than the Scepter 8, yet 
both were sold at lower prices, w ith the lowest cost device sold at {[ ]} less than the 
claimed market value of the Scepter 8.  
 
 
15 Currently, Amazon sells versions of its tablets with and without ad -supported lock screen s.  The tablet costs $15 
more without an ad -supported lock screen.  Amazon, Fire 7 tab let, 7" display, 16 GB, (2019 release), without 
lockscreen ads, Black , https://www.amazon.com/Fire -Tablet -7/dp/B07JQP283M?th=1  (last visited Nov. 17, 2022).  
Because it is unclear whet her the Amazon Fire device found at Best Buy includes ads, an additional $15 is added to 
the price to account for the possible removal of the ads.  “Amazon makes you pay back any discount you received 
on your tablet when you agreed to see ads.  The cost to  remove them later will be around $15 to $20.”  Smart Home

16 This type of processor is a “system -on-a-chip” design that incorporates multiple components into one. 
These  systems -on-a-chip (SoCs) designs integrate the RAM  and graphics into a single silicon chip.  “This h as some 
implications, as two similar chips ’ processor cores may have different amounts of memory and different graphics 
engines, which can cause variations in performance.  Manufacturers might alter the design, but for the most part, 
performance is similar  between products within the same base design.”   Mark Kyrnin, Evaluating Tablet PCs Based 
on Processors (Dec. 2, 2020), https://www.lifewire.com/guide -to-tablet -processors -832330 .

15. Given the fairly broad range of prices and technical specifications  for devices  identified in Tables 
2 and 3, each of the identified devices was closely examined to identify those devices that were 
“closest”  to the Scepter 8 in terms of their technical specifications .  In making this determination 
additional factors were considered, s uch as whether the device is bundled with additional 
accessories, whether it was targeted towards children, or was from a well -known tablet 
manufacturer that may signal higher quality components.  Among the 7 -inch screen devices listed 
in Table 2, the foll owing two devices we identified as closest to the Scepter 8.  First, was the 
Hyundai HyTab 7WC1; it had  the same processor as t he Scepter 8, but twice the ROM and a 
better camera.17  It had a price of $50 .00 to $60 .00 during the relevant period.   
16. The seco nd device identified was the Amazon Fire 7, which was and is widely sold; it has the 
same RAM and ROM as the Scepter 8, an only slightly slower clock speed processor, but it has a 
better camera and is a brand name product.  It sold for between $50 .00 and $65.00. 
17. Among the 8 -inch devices listed in Table 3, the device we identified as most similar was the 
Hyundai HyTab 8WC1 .  It had the same processor and RAM as the Scepter 8, but it ha d twice the 
ROM and it ha d a slightly faster processor and a better camera.  It sold for $70 .00.   
18. Based on this analysis of the retail prices for the most comparable tablets sold during the same 
time p eriod, it appears that a conservative estimate of the market value of the Scepte r 8 is 
between $ 50.00 and something less than $70.00.  This conclusion is based on the following 
observations.  First, the  8-inch tablet with the technical specifications  most similar to the Scepter 
8 is the Hyundai 8WC1.  The 8WC1  had the same Allwinner A100 processor, but a better 
camera, double the ROM, and a higher capacity battery, and it sold for only $70 .00 during the 
relevant period.  Given that it has so many technical specifications  that are superior to the Scepter 
8, a $70 .00 upper bou nd is conservative.   Also, the Gateway 8”, with more RAM and more ROM 
– sold for only $65 during the relevant period.   Second, while there are some tablets in our 
 
17 While the Contixo V8 had  technical specifications  more similar to the Scepter 8 than the HyTab 7WC1, as noted 
above it is also a tablet targeted at parents with children that comes with a bumper and educational software and 
parental controls.  These extr a features tend to increase the price of a tablet and therefore we concluded that the 
7WC1 was the closest comparable.  
699 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23-2 
 analysis that sold for $ 80.00, these tablets were either tablets targeted at parents with chi ldren that 
are bundled with features that significantly raise retail prices or were tablets, such as the Cooper s 
CP80 and Hyundai 8WB1, that have technical specifications  far superior to the Scepter 8.  
Further, an analysis of the incremental value  of addi ng these types of upgrades to a tablet shows 
that these superior features would be expected to raise the market value by at least $10 .00, but 
likely closer to $20 .00.18 
 
 
 
18 For example, the Hyundai 8WB1 has 1 GB of additional RAM and 3MP of additional camera resolution 
compared to the Hyundai 8WC1 and cost s $10 .00 more.  Also, the Fire 7 " with 32 GB of ROM costs $20 .00 more 
than an identical Fire 7 " tablet with 16GB of ROM.

I. INTRODUCTION
1. In this Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we 
establish a comprehensive and coordinated nationwide approach to managing the 4.9 GHz (4940-4990 
MHz) band while retaining its locally controlled, public safety nature.  In doing so, we solidify the band’s 
status as public safety spectrum, while also allowing secondary, non-public safety use as agreed to by 
public safety licensees through a new leasing model.  Critical to this vision for the 4.9 GHz band is the 
addition of a nationwide Band Manager, which will be selected based on its expertise and connections to 
the public safety community and will coordinate all operations in the band to ensure that any non-public 
safety use remains fully secondary to, and preemptible by, public safety operations.  This nationwide 
framework will optimize public safety use and enable the integration of the latest commercially available 
technologies, such as 5G.
2. The Seventh Report and Order also modifies our rules to allow for the collection of 
granular data on public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band.  These data combined with a formal 
coordination structure performed by the Band Manager will improve interference mitigation efforts, 
bolster public safety confidence in the band, and will play a crucial role in the Band Manager’s ability to 
find opportunities for secondary, non-public safety access.  We also make several changes to the technical 
rules for the band to promote more robust public safety operations.  Finally, in the Ninth Further Notice, 
we seek comment on the details of implementing the new leasing model to achieve our goals of allowing 
robust locally controlled public safety operations while ensuring consistent, nationwide rules that promote 
overall spectral efficiency, foster innovation, and drive down equipment costs.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Current 4.9 GHz Band Rules
3. The current licensing and regulatory regime for the 4.9 GHz band is significantly 
different from other public safety bands.  As an initial matter, the 4.9 GHz band has looser eligibility 
requirements; unlike the 700 MHz band which has statutorily defined eligibility criteria,1 or the Public 
Safety pool which has Commission-defined eligibility criteria,2 an entity need only provide public safety 
1 See 47 U.S.C. § 337(f)(1)(B). 
2 See 47 CFR § 90.20.
705Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
services to be eligible for a 4.9 GHz license.3  Licensees include state and local government entities,4 as 
well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that support communications essential to services having 
the sole or principal purpose of protecting the safety of life, health, or property.5  
4. The 4.9 GHz band is shared amongst eligible licensees—no licensee has a right to 
exclusive, or interference free, access to the band.6  Similarly, unlike other public safety bands that only 
authorize operations on specific frequencies and in clearly delineated geographic areas, 4.9 GHz band 
licenses authorize operation on any channel over the entire 50 megahertz of the band and are generally 
issued for the geographic area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of the licensee.7  Moreover, a 4.9 GHz 
licensee has blanket authority to operate base stations and mobile units (including portables and handheld 
units) and/or temporary (one year or less) fixed stations anywhere within its authorized area.8  Our rules 
also permit eligible entities to license fixed point-to-point (P-P) and point-to-multipoint (P-MP) 
operations on specific channels within their jurisdictions, although only those fixed sites that are used to 
deliver broadband service are accorded “primary” status under the rules.9
5. While licensees in this band are geographically limited to the state or local jurisdictions 
specified on the license,10 they are also permitted to operate base stations with mobile units and temporary 
fixed stations outside their authorized area with the permission of the jurisdiction in which they will 
operate.11  This licensing scheme means that licenses often overlap with one or more geographic area 
licenses covering a given location and authorizing operations on the same spectrum, as well as multiple 
fixed-site licenses in the same area.12  The Commission established this flexible structure based on public 
safety agencies’ unique history of coordination with one another in the use of shared frequencies.13  Our 
4.9 GHz rules, however, historically have not specified a formal coordination requirement.14
3 Id. § 90.1203(a) (referring to 47 CFR § 90.523(b) which allows a nongovernmental organization that provides 
services, the sole or principal purpose of which is to protect the safety of life, health, or property, to hold a license in 
the band). 
4 Id. § 90.523(a).
5 Id. § 90.523(b).  In addition, to establish eligibility, a NGO must also secure and maintain the support for the right 
to operate its system from a state or local governmental entity whose mission is to oversee or provide services that 
have the sole or principal purpose of protecting the safety of life, health or property, and the NGO must provide a 
written certification of such support in any submitted application.  Id.
6 Id. § 90.1209(a). 
7 Id. § 90.1207(a).  In the case of a NGO, the license is issued for the legal jurisdiction of the state or local 
government entity supporting the NGO.  Id.  Some licenses are issued for only part of a licensee’s jurisdiction, for 
example, an area defined by a point and a specified radius of operation.
8 Id. § 90.1207(b).
9 Id. § 90.1207(d).
10 Id. § 90.1207.
11 Id. § 90.1207(c).
12 For example, a common scenario might involve a statewide license held by the state police, a county-wide license 
held by the sheriff’s department, and fixed-site licenses operating in the same area by various public safety entities.  
Licensees informally cooperate with one another to ensure that their operations do not cause interference with one 
another, and to resolve interference if it occurs.

Report and Order, 18 FCC Rcd 9152, 9164, para. 28 (2003) (4.9 GHz Third Report and Order) (“We note that many 
public safety agencies already have procedures or protocols in place with nearby jurisdictions to govern frequency 
sharing during situations requiring joint operations.”  The Commission also explained that “the nature of public 
safety operations in general will . . . facilitate this sharing requirement.”).

B. Current State of the 4.9 GHz Band
6. There are 3,541 licenses currently issued in the band.15  This includes 137 statewide area 
licenses, 1,145 countywide area licenses, and 2,259 other licenses, either for geographic area licenses or 
other types (such as for a group of counties, a city, or parts of one or more cities) or for fixed sites.16  
Most of the United States and U.S. territories are covered by at least one statewide license.17  In some 
states, multiple state entities hold statewide licenses.18  Licensees use P-P and P-MP operations, to 
facilitate video streaming, communications system backhaul, and data connections for advanced 
devices.19  Commenters have suggested that emerging and potential uses of the band may include robotics 
and airborne operations, as well as the Internet of Things.20
C. Procedural History
7. In 2002, the Commission designated the 4.9 GHz band for public safety use.21  
Operations in the band are limited to those in support of public safety operations22 and licenses for the 
band are exclusively available to public safety entities or those operating in support of public safety.23  
Since the designation of the band, the rules have evolved in response to changing conditions, including 
15 Universal Licensing System, FCC, https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp (last visited Jan. 
10, 2023). 
16 For example, Southwestern NH District Fire Mutual Aid holds a license, call sign WQNM520, covering three 
counties in New Hampshire.
17 The following states/territories are not covered by a statewide license:  American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, 
the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota.
18 For example, the State of Maryland holds a statewide 4.9 GHz band license (WPYX998), as do four other 
agencies of the Maryland state government (Maryland State Highway Administration – WQAN291; Maryland 
Department of Information Technology – WPYZ305; Maryland DNR – WPYT728; Maryland MIEMSS – 
WQAL856).

band use and technological innovation.24  In these endeavors, the Commission has sought to increase the 
use of the band with the goal of maximizing the spectrum’s potential.25
8. Sixth Further Notice .  On March 23, 2018, the Commission adopted the Sixth Further 
Notice.  The Notice , drawing on comments in the record as well as a plan submitted by NPSTC in 2013 
and a report provided by APCO in 2015,26 sought comment on several alternatives to stimulate 
investment in, as well as expand use of, the 4.9 GHz band. 
9. Freeze Public Notice.  In an effort to stabilize the band while the Commission considers 
changes to its rules as part of this proceeding,27 on September 8, 2020, the Public Safety and Homeland 
Security Bureau (PSHSB) and the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB) (collectively the 
Bureaus) announced a freeze on applications in the 4.9 GHz band.28  Pursuant to the Freeze Public 
Notice , the Bureaus stopped accepting applications for new or modified licenses, including both 
geographic area licenses and individual fixed-site licenses.29  
10. Sixth Report and Order and Seventh Further Notice.  On September 30, 2020, the 
Commission adopted the Sixth Report and Order and Seventh Further Notice in this proceeding.30  The 
new leasing framework adopted in the Sixth Report and Order granted states the option to lease spectrum 
access through a single statewide entity designated as the State Lessor to state and local entities—whether 
public safety or non-public safety—as well as to commercial and other private entities in their

of the Commission’s Rules, WP Docket No. 07-100, Sixth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 33 FCC Rcd 
3261 (2018) (Sixth Further Notice).
25 The Commission has also received extensive input from public safety organizations such as the Association of 
Public-Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc. (APCO) and the National Public Safety 
Telecommunications Council (NPSTC).  See, e.g., APCO International, 4.9 GHz Task Force Report (2015),

27 This proceeding began in 2007, and has been the subject of ongoing efforts from the Commission and the public 
safety community to make the most of this valuable spectrum.  Amendment of Part 90 of the Commission’s Rules,

Filing Freeze on the Acceptance and Processing of Certain Part 90 Applications for the 4940-4990 MHz Band, WP 
Docket No. 07-100, Public Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 9522 (PSHSB/WTB 2020) (Freeze Public Notice).  The Freeze 
Public Notice also noted that any 4.9 GHz licensee could seek relief from the freeze through the Commission’s 
waiver provisions.  Id. at 9523. 
29 See Freeze Public Notice.
30 Sixth Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 1959.  In the Seventh Further Notice, the Commission, among other 
things, proposed an expansion of the new state-based framework to include public safety operations and proposed to 
amend its 4.9 GHz licensing rules to limit future licensing to state entities seeking a statewide license in states 
without an existing statewide license for purposes of this coordination.  Seventh Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 
1977-82, paras. 48-60.

jurisdictions.31  State Lessors were also permitted to use the band for non-public safety purposes 
themselves.32 
11. Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice.  The Commission subsequently 
adopted the Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice  on September 30, 2021.33  The Order 
on Reconsideration, issued before the framework adopted in the Sixth Report and Order could become 
effective, granted three public safety organization petitions insofar as they sought reconsideration of the 
rules adopted in the Sixth Report and Order.34  We agreed that, rather than allowing State Lessors to use 
and lease the band for non-public safety purposes, the public interest would be better served by 
considering other models, in particular those that advanced a single, nationwide framework for the band.  
As discussed below, the Commission also directed the Bureaus to lift, in part, the licensing freeze adopted 
in advance of the Sixth Report and Order, thereby allowing incumbents to modify their existing licenses 
or to license new permanent fixed sites.  The freeze was to remain in place as to non-incumbent 
applicants for 4.9 GHz band licenses. 
12. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on important technical 
and policy questions concerning how to maximize the use of the band to support public safety, leverage 
technological advancements (such as 5G), foster a robust equipment market, and address non-public 
safety use of the band on a nationwide basis.35  In contrast to the State Lessor model, which would have 
led to different practices for the band in different states, the Commission sought comment on a unified 
approach across the entire country.  We thus sought input on requiring formal frequency coordination in 
the 4.9 GHz band to support interference protection and increase public safety confidence in using the 
band.36  In addition, the Commission asked about the role of the Regional Planning Committees (RPCs), 
and whether, if we adopted frequency coordination requirements, the RPCs have the technical expertise 
and resources to serve as coordinators.37  We also solicited feedback on several alternatives to promote 
innovation, stimulate investment, and facilitate robust public safety access in the 4.9 GHz band.38  
Further, the Commission sought comment on establishing a database that would contain consistent and 
reliable information about what spectrum is available and where and how it is being used.39  
13. Alongside these potential changes, the Commission inquired about allowing non-public 
safety use of the band to encourage a more robust and innovative equipment market without causing

identified in the Commission’s 911 Fee Report from December 2019 as diverting 911 fees for non-911 purposes to 
lease spectrum rights to non-public safety or public safety entities.  Id. at 1967-68, paras. 23-24; see also FCC,

33 Order on Reconsideration and Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15032.  On May 27, 2021, the Commission 
granted the Public Safety Spectrum Alliance’s Petition for Stay of the Sixth Report and Order, which stayed the 
implementation of the new leasing framework adopted in the Sixth Report and Order for the 4.9 GHz band, which 
had not yet become effective, pending a Commission decision on the petitions for reconsideration filed in this 
proceeding.  Amendment of Part 90 of the Commission’s Rules, WP Docket No. 07-100, Order, 36 FCC Rcd 9761

harmful interference to public safety operations in the band.40  The Commission emphasized the 
importance of public safety operations in this band, but sought comment on how allowing non-public 
safety use could not only lower equipment and deployment costs but also increase efficient use of 
spectrum, without undermining critical public safety operations.  
14. In addition, we sought comment on implementing a nationwide spectrum management 
framework reflecting public safety input that “will promote more opportunistic use of the 4.9 GHz band 
without compromising the integrity and security of public safety operations.”41  More specifically, the 
Commission asked about designating a single entity to serve as a nationwide band manager or licensee for 
the 4.9 GHz band and what its responsibilities would be under such an approach.42  
15. Freeze Modification Public Notice.  On October 21, 2021, pursuant to the Order on 
Reconsideration, the Bureaus amended the freeze to allow those with existing 4.9 GHz licenses to seek to 
modify those licenses, whether for permanent fixed sites or geographic areas, as permitted under the 
rules.43
III. SEVENTH REPORT AND ORDER
A. Overview and Key Findings
16. Today we adopt rules that create a comprehensive and coordinated nationwide approach 
to the 4.9 GHz band, centralizing management in a single Band Manager, while retaining local control 
over operations conducted by individual public safety licensees.  This framework will retain the band’s 
existing status as a locally controlled public safety band, but with more rationalized and coordinated 
public safety operations on a nationwide level.  Each licensee will retain the authority to decide for itself 
how best to use the band, given its unique circumstances and needs, but within the context of a 
predictable and consistent spectral framework nationwide.  This will enable greater public safety use, 
including for 5G, and allow the Band Manager to work with public safety licensees to rationalize their use 
and consolidate their operations, potentially freeing up new opportunities for expanded use.  These 
expanded operations will encompass both primary public safety use and, subject to coordination by the 
Band Manager, secondary non-public safety use, the latter of which will be subject to preemption by 
public safety operations.  This balanced approach will spur innovation and drive down costs, enabling 
more efficient use of this important mid-band spectrum.
17. Implementing a centralized coordination strategy will provide better information and 
certainty about existing users and public safety deployments, which in turn will help leverage new 
technologies, lower equipment costs, attract new users, facilitate effective frequency coordination and 
interference protection, and promote interoperability.  We believe this structure will foster greater 
development and deployment of 4.9 GHz band equipment and systems, increasing spectral efficiency and 
furthering the public interest, while retaining the operational flexibility and local control that have been

Also, an incumbent licensee may continue to seek an individual station license if required pursuant to Commission 
rule section 90.1207(b)(1).  Id. § 90.1207(b)(1).  In addition to new deployments within its jurisdiction pursuant to 
an existing geographic area license, a public safety entity may expand operations through leasing from a State 
Lessor.  Order on Reconsideration, 36 FCC Rcd at 15041-42, para. 25.

the hallmarks of the band’s structure.  This will move the band away from being underutilized and 
towards being a workhorse not only for public safety operations, but also for non-public safety uses.
B. Band Manager
18. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on revisions to the 4.9 
GHz service rules to expand access to the band, spur innovation, improve coordination, and drive down 
costs for operators and end users through a new, nationwide framework for the band.44  We noted the 
critical importance of incumbent public safety operations and the need to preserve local control over the 
band, both to accommodate the localized nature of public safety operations and to continue to allow the 
wide range of public safety uses that the band hosts.45  At the same time, we emphasized that it was 
crucial that there be a single set of rules governing the band nationwide.46  We pointed out that 
centralizing management of the band would help ensure that public safety operators have consistent rules 
and a harmonized equipment marketplace, and that any non-public safety use would be standardized and 
predictable.47  
19. The Commission also solicited comment on different ways to balance these goals, 
including via designation of a nationwide Band Manager.48  We pointed to our experience with band 
managers in the 700 MHz Guard Bands and the 220 MHz band as precedents for using such an entity to 
establish a nationwide framework here.49  Commenters expressed significant support for a nationwide 
band manager stating that doing so “further ensure[s] public safety interoperability”50 and that it is “the 
most effective way to maximize the utilization of the 4.9 GHz band.”51 
20. In this Seventh Report and Order, we adopt a single, nationwide framework for the 4.9 
GHz band, that is centered around a new Band Manager, which will be equipped with additional 
information about the current public safety use of the band and empowered to work with public safety 
licensees to ensure efficient use of this spectrum and enable new, non-commercial operations on a 
secondary, preemptable basis.  We believe that a nationwide Band Manager will be able to effectively 
protect the interests of incumbent public safety users by establishing consistent, nationwide rules 
governing use of the band and providing new opportunities for non-public safety access to the band.52

the 4.9 GHz band is to create a nationwide license and authorize a nationwide band manager to implement and 
enforce priority and preemption rights for public safety, and to permit use of the band for 5G public safety services, 
while also allowing secondary use of the spectrum on a noninterfering and pre-emptible basis”); see also IAFC Dec. 
20, 2021, Reply at 4 (agreeing “with the PSSA that a nationwide band manager would be the most efficient way to 
ensure consistency throughout the country”, adding that “a nationwide band manager would implement and enforce 
priority and preemption rights for public safety and allow secondary use of the spectrum on a noninterfering and 
preemptive basis.”); Neil Horden Jan. 18, 2022, Ex Parte at 2 (“Only the establishment of a national strategy and

responsible for the “development of a 4.9 GHz spectrum band utilization strategy and policies”).

be empowered to clear 4.9 GHz spectrum of secondary users when public safety users need the band for local, 
(continued….)
711Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
We also believe this approach will spur innovation and drive down costs while ensuring full protection for 
authorized public safety operations.53  Crucially, the Band Manager will ensure that local governments 
can continue to use the band to suit their unique spectrum needs, while promoting the most efficient use 
of spectrum and creating a consistent and clear band framework nationwide.  We therefore find that 
designating a nationwide Band Manager to coordinate public safety access and facilitate the introduction 
of non-public safety services to the band will best serve the public interest.
1. Selecting the Band Manager
21. In the Eighth Further Notice, we sought comment on the process for accepting 
applications and selecting the entity that will manage leasing to non-public safety entities.54  We also 
sought comment on the criteria to be used to certify coordinators of public safety operations in the band.55  
Based on past Commission experience, we find that it is in the public interest for the Band Manager—
who will fill both roles—to be chosen by a selection committee that represents and ensures the 
involvement of the relevant stakeholders, in particular the public safety community.  The Commission has 
successfully used similar selection committees in other proceedings, such as the 700 MHz and 800 MHz 
proceedings,56 and most recently in the 3.7 GHz57 and 3.45 GHz58 clearinghouse selections, to enable 
interested parties to choose who can most effectively manage complex coordination efforts.  In the 3.7 
GHz proceeding, for example, the Commission used a selection committee to evaluate and choose the 3.7 
GHz relocation clearinghouse, the entity responsible for the multi-billion dollar relocation reimbursement 
process, which is an essential component of transitioning that critical mid-band spectrum to enable new 
wireless operations.59  A similar process is underway in the 3.45 GHz band.60  These selection committees 
have successfully incorporated feedback from relevant stakeholders to facilitate the choice of well-
qualified clearinghouse candidates in the aforementioned bands.  We believe using a selection committee 
in the 4.9 GHz band will similarly enable the efficient use of mid-band spectrum here, while ensuring that 
the Band Manager is representative of and fully supported by the public safety community. 
22. A stakeholder-led process will be particularly useful for the selection of the Band 
Manager in the instant case, because the Band Manager’s connections with the public safety community 
will form the backbone of its work.  The trust and understanding of the public safety community, as well 
as its voluntary cooperation with and buy-in to the Band Manager’s mission, will be essential to achieving 
regional, or even nationwide incidents.”); PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 2 (“As the PSSA previously stated, a

both band rationalization and use maximization of spectrum rights.  The selection committee, which will 
be named by the Commission, will choose from a pool of qualified applicants, and as in prior cases, the 
final selection will be subject to a finding by the Commission that the selection satisfies the criteria 
established by the selection committee.  While we seek comment on the rights and responsibilities of the 
Band Manager—which will form the basis for the committee’s selection criteria—the composition of the 
selection committee, and other process details in the Ninth Further Notice, we find that utilizing a 
selection committee will ensure that the Band Manager, once chosen, will adequately represent the public 
safety community and foster a cooperative environment that promotes the efficient management and use 
of this band.  We delegate to the Bureaus the authority to manage the process of determining the selection 
committee’s responsibilities, including by issuing public notices as necessary to obtain additional 
comment to address questions regarding the selection committee.
2. Band Manager Responsibilities
23. Once selected, the Band Manager will have three primary responsibilities: (1) frequency 
coordination; (2) incentivizing the use of the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G; 
and (3) facilitating secondary non-public safety use.  We describe each responsibility below, and seek 
comment in the Ninth Further Notice  on questions related to the implementation of these provisions, as 
well as the Commission’s role in ensuring the Band Manager can achieve these goals.  
24. Frequency Coordination.  In the Eighth Further Notice, we sought comment on whether 
frequency coordination should be incorporated into management of the band to support efficient and 
interference-free access for public safety operations.61  Based on record support, we assign to the Band 
Manager responsibility for performing the frequency coordination function for public safety applicants 
seeking to license new or modify existing facilities in the band, thus ensuring the efficient assignment and 
use of spectrum by public safety licensees.62  As discussed below,63 the Band Manager will perform its 
frequency coordination duties consistent with the Commission’s rules, once adopted,64 and with input 
from public safety licensees and applicants to ensure that they are able to access sufficient spectrum for 
their operations.  In doing so, the Band Manager will advise and help public safety licensees and 
applicants to design their deployments in order to promote efficient and robust use of the band and 
prevent harmful interference to other licensees.  The Band Manager will not, however, have the authority 
to disallow proposed public safety operations or otherwise limit public safety operations once a public 
safety entity is licensed to operate in the band.  Instead, the Band Manager will provide public safety 
licensees and applicants with recommendations for the technical characteristics of a proposed system, 
subject to Commission review in the case of any objections to such recommendations.  While the Band

manager who will issue the order to provide both the public-safety community and secondary users with the type of

majority of those submitting comments are in general agreement that . . . [t]he rules applicable to the use of the 4.9 
GHz should be harmonized with those applicable to other frequency bands supporting public safety 
communications, including the use of Commission certified frequency coordinators in the licensing process[.]”).

Manager will ensure that consistent criteria are used to evaluate the potential for harmful interference, and 
that all 4.9 GHz operations are designed with the same best practices for efficient spectrum use, it will not 
impose any limits on public safety use of the band.  We recognize that the success of this framework will 
depend in part on public safety licensees’ cooperation and responsible use of spectrum, and given the 
history of collaboration within this community we anticipate few, if any, issues.  
25. Technological Incentivization.  The Eighth Further Notice also sought comment on 
commercial 5G offerings available to public safety, and on any public safety use cases supported by 5G 
and other advanced technologies.65  The Commission further raised the potential for the 4.9 GHz band to 
support applications enabled by 5G technology, but it expressed a strong preference to adhere to a 
technology-neutral policy for the band and strive for operational flexibility.66  
26. In response, several commenters supported the deployment and integration of 
commercially available technologies such as 5G in the 4.9 GHz band,67 with some commenters stating 
that frequency coordination and facilitation by a Band Manager may be necessary if advanced 
technologies are introduced into the band.68  For instance, NPSTC asserted that advanced technologies, 
such as 5G, must be deployed in such a way that supports continued public safety operations.69  
27. Based on the comments before us, we conclude that the Band Manger should use its 
background and expertise to determine and recommend, as part of a spectrum plan for the band and for 
the benefit of any interested licensees and lessees, how best to incorporate the latest commercially 
available technologies, including 5G, into the 4.9 GHz band in a manner that supports and protects public 
safety operations.  We decline to mandate the use of such technologies in the band, as we agree that this 
more restrictive approach could limit the use of certain equipment by incumbent licensees.70  In keeping

with our goal of protecting public safety operations, we will require the Band Manager to seek input from 
licensees and work to facilitate the deployment of advanced wireless technologies in a manner that 
supports and protects public safety users.  We also seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice below on 
ways to further encourage the deployment of the latest commercially available technologies below in the 
Ninth Further Notice.71  
28. Facilitating Non-Public Safety Access.  While the Commission emphasized the 
importance of public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band in the Eighth Further Notice, we also 
recognized that introducing non-public safety operations in the band may help foster innovation and drive 
down equipment costs, thereby making more intensive public safety use of the spectrum a possibility.72  
To that end, we sought comment on expanding use of the band to non-public safety entities, subject to 
appropriate safeguards to protect public safety operations.73  In response, various commenters supported 
introducing non-public safety users into the band, asserting that this could foster a “‘virtuous cycle’ of 
reduced costs,”74 “create opportunities for incumbents and new entrants alike”, and “encourage equipment 
manufacturers to innovate and develop an expanded device ecosystem.”75  Commenters cautioned, 
however, that public safety operations must be protected from harmful interference if the band is opened 
to non-public safety use.76
29. Today, we adopt new rules to allow limited non-public safety access to the 4.9 GHz band, 
on a secondary basis to, and subject to preemption by, public safety licensees, which will remain the 
primary users of the band.  This expanded access for non-public safety entities will rely on a Band 
Manager-facilitated spectrum leasing framework premised on the Band Manager’s analysis of where, 
when, and at what frequencies non-public safety operations can take place without impacting public 
safety operations.  The Band Manager will identify, based on consultation with relevant public safety 
licensees and its own expertise, situations where there are unused spectrum access opportunities.  This 
cooperative process will enable the Band Manager to take advantage of both its expertise on 4.9 GHz 
band public safety operations and its extensive links with the public safety community to identify 
spectrum access opportunities potentially available to non-public safety entities with flexibility to permit 
regional variation and maximize spectrum use, but also enough consistency to ensure full protection for 
current and future public safety operations.  We believe this approach strikes the proper balance between 
allowing localized control of public safety operations and reducing interference, while also ensuring that 
consistent, nationwide rules will promote overall spectral efficiency, foster innovation, and drive down 
equipment costs.77  We elaborate further on this approach below in this Seventh Report and Order, and 
seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on the details of implementing the Band Manager facilitated

non-public safety leasing model to achieve these goals.  
C. Licensing Database
30. The Commission sought comment in the Eighth Further Notice  on collecting more 
granular data on 4.9 GHz operations in a licensing database and combining that data with a formal 
coordination structure to improve interference mitigation efforts and bolster public safety confidence in 
the band.78  We also sought comment on whether to continue using the Universal Licensing System 
(ULS) or transition to a third-party licensing database to accommodate additional information.79  
31. Commenting parties overwhelmingly supported the collection of more granular data on 
public safety operations.80  In particular, filers supported the collection of complete microwave path data 
for fixed links and site-by-site data on base stations (currently licensed under the geographic licensing 
scheme) as proposed in the Eighth Further Notice.81  Commenters also universally supported keeping 
ULS over transitioning to a third-party database.82  For example, EWA stated that “there is no need to 
look beyond the FCC’s own” ULS and argued there is no “rationale to support the introduction of a third-
party managed database that would replicate capabilities already available in ULS.”83  Commenting 
parties also explained that transitioning to a third-party database would result in added delays and 
additional costs for licensees.84

32. Finally, commenters overwhelmingly supported at least a one-year period for incumbent 
licensees to submit the necessary technical details into ULS.85  For instance, NPSTC said it would prefer a 
shorter deadline but believes many licensees with extensive deployments in the band “may not already 
have full geographic or technical information at its fingertips and may need to determine that information 
for numerous facilities.”86  BART estimated it will need at least eight hours per site to collect the 
necessary information from the hundreds of fixed sites in its 131.4 mile network.87  Therefore, BART 
indicated it will need one year to eighteen months to submit the necessary data into ULS.88  
33. We agree with commenting parties that collecting additional technical data on public 
safety operations will improve interference protection and give public safety licensees more confidence in 
the band without adding a significant burden on licensees or applicants.89  We further believe that having 
more granular technical data will help the Band Manager perform its duties and enable non-public safety 
use of excess capacity in the band without causing interference.  As such, we adopt our proposal to collect 
more granular data on public safety deployments and will provide incumbent licensees a one-year period 
to submit the necessary technical detail.  We also agree with commenting parties that ULS can be 
modified to collect the more granular data described above and that transitioning to a third-party database 
would introduce added delays and complexity.90  Therefore, we will continue using ULS as the licensing 
database for public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band.  
34. Consequently, we direct the Bureaus to make any necessary enhancements to ULS, to 
obtain any necessary review under the Paperwork Reduction Act, and announce by public notice when 
ULS is prepared to accept the more granular data on public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band.  
Consistent with record support, we will require incumbent licensees and future applicants to supply 
complete microwave path data for fixed links, and to obtain a license for base stations (currently 
authorized under the geographic license scheme) on a site-by-site basis.91  We direct the Bureaus to 
modify ULS so that it can collect transmission data from incumbent licensees and future applicants.92  
Specifically, for licensees operating permanent fixed P-P, P-M and fixed receiver stations, the Bureaus 
should enhance ULS to collect transmitter and receiver antenna coordinates, frequencies, polarizations, 
tolerance, effective isotropic radiated power, emission designator, type of modulation, antenna model, 
gain, antenna center line height(s) above ground level and ground elevation above mean sea level, path

azimuth and distance.93  For licensees operating base/mobile, mobile-only or temporary fixed stations, the 
Bureaus should enhance ULS to collect coordinates (base), antenna height above average terrain (base), 
center frequency, emission designator, effective radiated power, number of units (mobile and temporary 
fixed), and area of operation (mobile and temporary fixed).  Licensees which fail to comply with this new 
requirement on the timeline specified by the Bureaus shall be subject to penalties as a violation of our 
rules.  
35. Finally, incumbent licensees will have at least one year from the publication of this item 
in the Federal Register to provide the required data in ULS.94  Given the record before us, we believe one 
year is sufficient time to allow licensees to confirm the necessary information about their existing 
deployments, and that this requirement will not be unduly burdensome for licensees, which already 
operate and maintain these deployments.95  Nonetheless, we encourage licensees to enter their data into 
ULS as soon as it is available once the Bureaus announce that the ULS modifications are complete and 
OMB has completed its review of any new collection requirements.
D. Frequency Coordination
36. The Eighth Further Notice also solicited comment on requiring formal frequency 
coordination in the 4.9 GHz band to support interference protection and increase public safety confidence 
in using the band.96  In particular, we sought input on whether mandatory frequency coordination would 
provide certainty and incentives for public safety to increase its use of the band,97 and if so, whether part 
90 type frequency coordination, part 101 type frequency coordination, or a combination of the two would 
be best suited for the 4.9 GHz band.98  As detailed below, we adopt a part 90 formal frequency 
coordination requirement for public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band and 
assign nationwide authority to the Band Manager to perform the coordination function.
37. Commenting parties overwhelmingly supported formal frequency coordination to bolster 
interference protection and increase public safety confidence in using the band.99  For instance, APCO 
stated that “[f]requency coordination is the most effective way to promote public safety use of the band” 
while EWA noted that frequency coordination has been used for years in other frequency bands to 
“promote sound spectrum management.”100  Based on the record before us, we adopt formal frequency 
93 API and ENTELEC oppose a polarization requirement since it believes any such requirement would be “limiting 
or impractical.”  See API and ENTELEC Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 5-6.  While we specify technical parameters 
for P-P, P-MP, and fixed receivers, we will not require licensees to deploy a certain type of polarization.

coordination procedures for the 4.9 GHz band to minimize the potential for interference and increase 
public safety confidence in the band.  In making this decision, we find persuasive arguments by 
commenting parties who believe the benefits of formal frequency outweigh any nominal costs.101  
38. Although commenters were split on the type of coordination that should be applied to 
public safety operations in the band,102 we find that part 90 coordination with the Band Manager serving 
as the nationwide frequency coordinator best suits our goal of establishing a nationwide framework for 
coordinating access to the 4.9 GHz band.  We note that part 90 coordination has for years reduced 
interference while promoting robust public safety operations in other frequency bands.103  In addition, by 
performing the frequency coordination function, the Band Manager can ensure the efficient assignment 
and use of spectrum by public safety licensees.  Therefore, we find the part 90 frequency coordination 
framework with the Band Manager serving as frequency coordinator preferable to a part 101-type 
coordination approach whereby applicants individually coordinate proposed facilities with existing 
licensees and other applicants whose facilities could be affected by the new proposal.104  Furthermore, we 
assign the frequency coordination function solely to the Band Manager (as opposed to allowing 
competitive coordination) because we find that a single nationwide coordinator is preferable for 4.9 GHz 
since we are implementing a nationwide framework for use of the band in contrast to other part 90 bands 
where coordination is more local or regional.105    
39. Under the part 90 coordination framework we adopt today, the Band Manager will review 
applications from public safety entities seeking to license new or modify existing facilities in the 4.9 GHz 
band before they are filed with the Commission.  As frequency coordinator, the Band Manager, utilizing 
the interference criteria on which we seek comment on below,106 and the more granular data collected in

considerably less than the potential costs of interference mitigation, frustration, and loss of system operation as a 
result of interference from improperly licensed or un-coordinated systems”).
102 Some commenting parties prefer part 90 coordination, others part 101 coordination and some did not specify 
what type of coordination they prefer.  See Caltrans Nov. 23, 2021, Comments at 6 (suggesting that “Point-to-Point 
applications follow the Part 101 guidelines” but noting that “coordination through the Part 90 process will also be 
required” since the 4.9 GHz band supports “the use of mobile units” as well); Cal OES Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 
3 (supporting “Part 90 formal coordination by a certified frequency coordinator”); APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments

“fixed point-to-point (P-P) and point-to-multipoint (P-MP) use, a propagation modeling approach . . . would be 
preferable to . . . Part 101 type coordination”); Joint Filers Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 (stating it looks “to our 
industry associations, such as APCO International, to work collegially with the broader user community to develop

ULS,107 will perform an analysis to determine if the proposed operation would cause interference to 
incumbent licensees or previously filed applicants.  The Band Manager may, if it so chooses, allow third 
parties to perform the interference analysis on its behalf.  The Band Manager, however, will have sole 
responsibility as frequency coordinator, subject to Commission review, for informing applicants if their 
proposed facilities would cause interference to either an incumbent licensee or an existing applicant under 
the criteria we eventually adopt for the band.  The Band Manager will be permitted to charge reasonable 
rates for its coordination services, the way other frequency coordinators do today, and we seek comment 
in the Ninth Further Notice below on any requirements we should put in place as to those fees.108  
40. Given the Band Manager is tasked with assisting public safety applicants with designing 
their deployments to promote efficient use of the band while preventing harmful interference to other 
licensees, as described above, we assign it authority to recommend to public safety applicants during the 
frequency coordination process the most appropriate channel(s), bandwidth, operating power, area of 
operation (if mobile or temporary fixed operation is requested), or any other technical criteria which 
promotes robust use of the band while minimizing interference to incumbent licensees.109  Per our part 90 
rules, applicants may request that the Commission overturn a frequency coordination recommendation 
from the Band Manager; however, any such applicant bears the burden of proof for demonstrating why 
the Commission should do so.110  
41. As is typical under part 90 frequency coordination, we afford the Band Manager here 
flexibility to approve applications which cause or receive more interference than provided for by the 
criteria we eventually adopt for the band, if the application includes a concurrence letter from each 
incumbent (or existing applicant) that would receive higher levels of interference or a statement from the 
applicant accepting higher levels of interference.111  We believe providing the Band Manager flexibility to 
approve such applications will promote more robust use of this band, for example by allowing licensees 
to elect to operate in closer proximity to each other than permitted by our rules, if they believe that their 
systems are more resistant to interference than our interference protection criteria assume.
42. Once the Band Manager is chosen and interference protection criteria are adopted, all 
applications filed with the Commission via ULS which seek to license new facilities or modify existing 
facilities in the 4.9 GHz band must include a showing of frequency coordination by the Band Manager.  
Below in the Ninth Further Notice, we seek comment on interference criteria to ensure public safety 
licensees have efficient and interference-free access to the band.  We also seek comment in the Ninth 
Further Notice on whether the Band Manager, as part of its frequency coordinator duties, should mediate 
disputes if parties disagree about existing or proposed operations.

to the applicant).

43. Finally, we decline to adopt a more active form of frequency coordination for public 
safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band, such as the automated frequency coordination in the 6 GHz band112 
or the spectrum access system that facilitates dynamic spectrum sharing in the Citizens Broadband Radio 
Service (CBRS).113  Given our adoption of a new Band Manager to coordinate access to the band, we find 
that the public interest is best served by adopting the part 90 frequency coordination framework, 
described above, which requires no modification of or replacement to equipment currently in use in the 
band and which grants to the Band Manager flexibility in working with licensees and lessees to maximize 
the efficient use of this spectrum.
E. Permitting Non-Public Safety Use of the Band
44. Alongside our decision today to adopt a nationwide Band Manager framework for the 4.9 
GHz band, we amend our rules to allow non-public safety use of the band as authorized by the Band 
Manager.  Specifically, we remove the restriction that 4.9 GHz band operations be in support of public 
safety, provided that any non-public safety operations must: (1) be authorized by the Band Manager; and 
(2) fully protect114 and, where necessary, be subject to preemption by, public safety operations in the 
band.  We believe that this will enable the Band Manager to determine where, when, and at what 
frequencies non-public safety operators can use the 4.9 GHz band without limiting access to the band for 
public safety purposes.115  We emphasize that we will not license non-public safety operators, and 
licensed operations will remain exclusively in support of public safety.  Non-public safety operations will 
be required to fully protect and, when necessary, abide by preemption rules regarding the public safety 
operations which will retain the primary use of the band.
45. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on a range of potential 
approaches to expand use of the 4.9 GHz band.  In particular, the Commission asked whether it is in the 
public interest to open the band to non-public safety uses and, if so, under what terms.116  Many 
commenters who supported sharing the spectrum argued that introducing new users into the band will 
allow for reduced costs and “encourage equipment manufacturers to innovate and develop an expanded 
device ecosystem.”117  The Eighth Further Notice  solicited input on leasing regimes that could be used to 
provide shared non-public safety access to the band while protecting critical public safety operations.118  
Commenters representing a range of interests supported a framework that allowed for the licensing of 
112 See Unlicensed Use of the 6 GHz Band; Expanding Flexible Use in Mid-Band Spectrum Between 3.7 and 24 
GHz, ET Docket No. 18-295 and GN Docket No. 17-183, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, 35 FCC Rcd 3852, 3862-77, paras. 23-67 (2020).  
113 See 47 CFR part 96.

protection of public safety operations under a new “harmful interference” standard which we will define in our rules.  
See infra  paras. 75-83.

secondary rights in the band to non-public safety entities,119 and filers representing public safety agencies 
also generally supported these goals.120  APCO, for example, noted that sharing the band with non-public 
safety operations could create “opportunities for incumbents and new entrants alike” and “encourage 
equipment manufacturers to innovate and develop an expanded device ecosystem.”121  Similarly, non-
public safety operators expressed interest in the band and noted that allowing them access will benefit not 
only the public interest, but also public safety users through reduced equipment costs.122  We believe this 
band has promise for a variety of innovative use cases, ranging from commercial wireless operations, 
including 5G, to fixed wireless broadband services, to private network operations, including those of 
critical infrastructure (CII) entities.  Commenters supported the secondary nature of such operations, and 
asserted their ability to protect public safety from interference.123  
46. We believe the approach we adopt today will allow local public safety entities to 
maintain control over their operations in the band while ensuring that non-public safety uses are subject to 
consistent nationwide rules that minimize the risk of interference, promote robust use, and ensure priority 
and preemption for public safety operations.124  We note that some public safety commenters expressed 
concerns about sharing with non-public safety users.  These commenters focused in particular on 
interference concerns,125 urging the Commission to make any non-public safety operations secondary if 
they are permitted.  We recognize the importance of protecting public safety operations from interference

124 Some commenters expressed that state management is the best approach; however, we believe the Commission 
sufficiently addressed this alternative in the Order on Reconsideration, which determined that a “state-by-state 
framework would have resulted in a patchwork of different rules, processes, and terms governing the use of the 
spectrum” where “decisions driving technical operations would be balkanized across the different states and 
territories.”  Order on Reconsideration, 36 FCC Rcd at 15039-40, paras. 20, 22; see also STARNet Nov. 24 2021,

and agree that non-public safety operations should be secondary to public safety uses, in addition to being 
coordinated by the Band Manager.
47. We find that we can meet our goal of promoting increased access to the 4.9 GHz band 
generally, in addition to promoting and protecting public safety use, by allowing non-public safety 
entities to lease unused spectrum from the public safety licensees through the Band Manager.  This model 
will ensure that leased operations will be on a non-interference basis, thereby, fully protecting public 
safety operations and providing a mechanism to enable preemption by public safety licensees.  While our 
action today opens the band for leased access by non-public safety operators, we seek comment in the 
Ninth Further Notice on how that access will be implemented and which non-public safety entities should 
be eligible to operate in the band.126
48. Based on our review of existing operations, there is potential for widespread use of the 
4.9 GHz band by non-public safety operators without impinging on public safety access.  For example, 
there is no statewide licensee for three states and two U.S. territories, meaning wide swaths of those areas 
likely host little to no 4.9 GHz band activity.127  Moreover, even where there is a statewide public safety 
licensee, it likely is not using the spectrum throughout the state, particularly given the band’s limited 
propagation characteristics.  We believe the Band Manager will be well-equipped to find these 
opportunities, based both on its expertise and experience with the band and on the new, more granular 
deployment data we will begin collecting in ULS, and be able to match them with the entities capable of 
making the best use of the band.  The Band Manager will evaluate all potential non-public safety 
operations based on consistent technical parameters and use restrictions deemed necessary to ensure full 
protection of public safety operations.  Allowing the Band Manager to centrally coordinate non-public 
safety access will promote a standardized set of rules and contractual provisions for such access, which 
ensure that public safety retains priority and preemption rights.128  
49. Under our current rules, 4.9 GHz licensees are permitted to enter into spectrum sharing 
arrangements with entities that do not meet the eligibility requirements for a license, so long as those 
entities use the spectrum in support of public safety.129  Here, we clarify that leases to non-public safety 
entities will only be permitted if they are coordinated and approved by the Band Manager, subject to any 
requirements we adopt pursuant to the Ninth Further Notice.  Public safety licensees will also continue to 
be able to enter directly into 4.9 GHz band sharing arrangements for public safety operations.
F. Priority and Preemption for Public Safety
50. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission additionally sought comment on affording 
public safety licensees priority access to the 4.9 GHz band, including the ability to preempt any non-
public safety operations that may be authorized in the future.130  In particular, we asked whether “public 
safety priority and preemption should be elements of any sharing model we ultimately adopt” if the 
Commission opens the 4.9 GHz band to non-public safety users.131  We also requested input on “the types 
of mission-critical public safety operations that should have priority over other public safety as well as

non-public safety operations” and “the technical feasibility of building priority and preemption algorithms 
into 4.9 GHz networks and equipment.”132
51. Parties commenting on this issue strongly supported affording public safety licensees 
priority access to the band over non-public safety users and the ability to preempt these operations when 
needed.133  For example, TDD indicated that priority and preemption is “an essential element of the public 
safety network, especially when non-public priority users are on the band.”134  AASHTO, Caltrans, 
BART, and IAFC, who opposed sharing the band with non-public safety users, supported priority and 
preemption under any sharing framework.135  
52. Accordingly, we will ensure public safety entities have priority access to the 4.9 GHz 
band through licensing on a primary basis, while non-public safety users will be permitted to operate in 
the band only on a secondary basis.  In other words, non-public safety users, subject to coordination and 
facilitation by the Band Manager, will only be permitted to operate in the band in a manner which causes 
no interference to primary public safety licensees, and with no interference protection from public safety 
operations.  Therefore, we conclude that by allowing non-public users to operate in the band only on a 
secondary basis we retain public safety’s ability to access the band on a priority basis.  
53. The Commission also sought comment in the Eighth Further Notice on “the types of 
mission-critical public safety operations that should have priority over other public safety . . . 
operations,”136 but no commenting party responded to this request.  The Commission does not typically 
prioritize one public safety entity over another when it processes license applications under part 90.137  
Therefore, we conclude that a local public safety community can adjudicate its own priority levels 
between public safety users since individual public safety incidents may have differing communication

priority.  However, the establishment of local priority levels does not preclude a licensee from exercising 
any rights or seeking any remedy available to it under our rules. 
54. Finally, although there was broad support for public safety licensees to have the ability to 
preempt non-public safety users, there was little detail in the record about how this would work in 
practice.138  Therefore, we seek comment below in the Ninth Further Notice on questions related to the 
Band Manager’s implementation of an appropriate pre-emption mechanism, including “shut down” 
procedures and possible limitations on preemption requests.
G. Annual Reports
55. The Eighth Further Notice also sought comment on whether to impose reporting 
requirements on any Band Manager designated to manage the 4.9 GHz band139 and, if so, what those 
reports should address and how often they should be filed with the Commission.140  We note that band 
managers in other frequency bands are required to submit annual reports.141  Consequently, we adopt an 
annual reporting requirement that will allow the Commission to oversee the Band Manager, ensure its 
activities advance the Commission’s stated goals for this band, and provide greater transparency, 
certainty, and predictability in the 4.9 GHz band.
56. The current record does not reflect input on the type of information that should be 
included in such reports.  Therefore, below in the Ninth Further Notice , we seek comment on the type of 
information the Band Manager should include in its annual report to facilitate oversight and ensure 
transparency, certainty, and predictability in the 4.9 GHz band.
H. Regional Planning Committees
57. Section 90.1211(a) of the current rules provides that each RPC may voluntarily submit a 
plan with guidelines to be used for sharing 4.9 GHz spectrum within the RPC region.  The Eighth Further 
Notice  inquired whether RPCs should play a continued or expanded role in the spectrum management 
framework for the 4.9 GHz band.142  In particular, we asked whether regional planning is consistent with 
the Commission’s goal of establishing a national framework for management of the band and, if so, what 
resources RPCs would need to ensure that plans were filed for all regions given that only 10 of 55 RPCs 
voluntarily filed plans to date.143

58. Commenting parties generally showed little enthusiasm for continuing or expanding the 
RPC’s current role.144  Although some commenters supported a continued role for the RPCs,145 many 
believed a lack of funding and resources for RPC’s, which are voluntary organizations, would hinder their 
ability to perform frequency coordination or spectrum management functions.146  For instance, NPSPTC 
stated that “given the current economic conditions, the necessary resources required for robust regional 
planning of the 4.9 GHz band throughout the country simply do not exist at this time.”147  Moreover, 
Region 20 noted the challenge RPCs would face if required to manage newer technologies such as LTE 
and 5G.148  We agree and decline to adopt a spectrum management role for RPCs in this band given the 
lack of necessary funding and resources for RPCs nationwide, lack of expertise in much of the new 
technology likely to be deployed in the band, and lack of consensus in the record that regional planning is 
consistent with our goal of establishing a nationwide framework for the band.
I. Interoperability Standards
59. The Commission also sought comment in the Eighth Further Notice on whether to adopt 
any technical standards that would promote interoperability in the 4.9 GHz band.149  Commenting parties 
were split on this question.  A few commenters believed the Commission should formulate and adopt 
technical standards to promote interoperability in the band.150  For instance, while not expressly 
advocating for the Commission to promulgate interoperability standards, IACP saw a need for systems 
operating in the 4.9 GHz band to “interoperate securely and reliably with existing land mobile radio 
legacy networks whenever possible and practical.”151  On the other hand, some commenting parties such 
as APCO, NPSTC, and IAFC recommended against the Commission developing interoperability 
standards for the band.152  NPSTC stated that “the diversity of uses in the 4.9 GHz band . . . makes

(noting that although “voluntary involvement of strong and knowledgeable regional planning committees has been 
helpful” in larger metropolitan areas the “current economic conditions . . . do not exist at this time” for robust

(citing NPSTC Comments).  But see Region 20 Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 4 (stating that “RPCs can play an

noting that if a new entrant to the band “desires to add private LTE, or in particular, private LTE with multiple 
eNodeB transmitter locations, technologies with which we are unfamiliar, the challenges of frequency coordination 
could be more challenging”).

designating an interoperability standard impractical,” and “fixed links . . . [do] not have an interface 
directly with public safety personnel on the street.”153
60. We agree with the latter position.  While we recognize that interoperability is an integral 
part of the public safety communications ecosystem, the lack of technical mandates in this band has led to 
the development of a variety of innovative uses, some of which have no need to work directly with one 
another.154  Consequently, given the wide variety of uses and potential uses of the band, we believe 
imposing interoperability standards at this juncture could lead to fewer equipment options thereby 
potentially stifling innovation and contradicting our goal of reducing equipment costs.155
J. Other Technical Issues
61. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on certain technical rule 
proposals from the Sixth Further Notice to increase utilization of the 4.9 GHz band.156  Below, we 
summarize each proposal, review the record, and set forth our decisions.
62. Channel Aggregation.  The Commission’s rules limit aggregation of channels in the 4.9 
GHz band to 20 megahertz bandwidth.157  In the Sixth Further Notice , the Commission proposed 
expanding the limit to 40 megahertz because it may enable public safety access to 5G technologies.158  
The majority of parties commenting on this issue supported expanding the aggregation limit with some 
suggesting that channel aggregation up to 50 megahertz be permitted.159  For instance, the IACP states 
that “the full 50 MHz of 4.9 GHz is best suited for 5G deployment.”160  We agree with these commenters 
that wider bandwidths should be permitted particularly, as commenters note, because 5G technology 
permits operation with a channel bandwidth up to 50 MHz.161  Therefore, we will allow channel 
aggregations up to 50 megahertz to provide maximum flexibility for channel licensing.  Unlike with a

for the current communications uses at 4.9 GHz, i.e., uses that will continue to be required by the public safety 
community”); APCO Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 6 (stating that “[t]he use cases for 4.9 GHz do not implicate the

smaller aggregation limit, this expanded limit will provide licensees with increased bandwidth and 
throughput and may encourage the use of new innovative technologies in the band.  Nonetheless, 
licensees and applicants should request no more bandwidth than necessary for a particular use.  As noted 
above, the requested bandwidths (among other technical parameters) on all applications seeking to license 
new or modified facilities will be subject to frequency coordination by the Band Manager, which may 
recommend bandwidth limits on a case-by-case basis as necessary to protect neighboring or overlapping 
users and ensure efficient operation in the band.  Finally, to promote economies of scale for the 
equipment market, the expanded limit will apply to all users; however, non-public safety users will be 
subject to any use restrictions, including potential bandwidth restrictions, that the Band Manger deems 
necessary to ensure full protection of public safety operations.
63. Primary Status for Fixed Links.  Currently, the rules accord primary status only to P-P 
and P-MP fixed links that deliver broadband traffic, while links that do not meet this criterion are 
secondary to other operations in the 4.9 GHz band.162  The Commission proposed to accord primary status 
for all P-P and P-MP links on Channels 14-18 of the band plan, including fixed links that operate with 
narrowband traffic.163  Maryland et al. and STARNet advocated for primary status “for the entire band, 
not merely channels 14-18.”164  Moreover, several public safety parties also supported removing the 
broadband requirement,165 and no filer in the latest comment window opposed extending primary status to 
fixed links on all channels in the band.  We believe that extending primary status to P-P and P-MP fixed 
links that operate only on Channels 14-18 in the band, as originally proposed, may continue to limit 
flexibility and make the band less attractive for investment.  Furthermore, we agree with those 
commenters that support removing the requirement that fixed links deliver broadband traffic in order to 
obtain primary status.  Accordingly, going forward we will authorize all P-P and P-MP links throughout 
the band on a primary basis including those transmitting narrowband traffic.  We will also permit 
licensees operating fixed links which are currently authorized on a secondary basis to seek to upgrade 
those links to primary status.  Applications requesting initial authorization for primary links or upgrades 
from secondary status to primary status for existing links will be accepted once a Band Manager is 
selected and the formal frequency coordination process described above is in place.
64. Temporary P-P Operation.  The Commission proposed to limit temporary P-P operation 
to thirty days maximum over a given path over a one-year period “in order to limit ‘temporary’ links to 
truly temporary uses.”166  Maryland et al. and STARNet opposed such a limit as excessive, noting that it 
would potentially constrict operations during a disaster or an on-going event.167  No filer in the latest 
comment window supported a limit on temporary P-P operations.  We agree that a limit on temporary P-P 
operations will limit flexibility in the band.  Accordingly, we decline to adopt this proposal.
65. Antenna Gain.  The Commission proposed to require a minimum antenna gain of 26 dBi 
for P-P antennas to “enable users to deploy larger directional antennas, . . . and to produce narrower beam 
widths and more directional P-P links, which should enable co-channel users in congested areas to place 
links closer together and achieve greater frequency reuse.”168  A majority of commenters opposed this

proposal.  For example, Maryland et al. and STARNet stated that they are “uncertain why the 
Commission focuses on a ‘minimum’ gain for antennas” and that “[t]his seems to contradict the goals of 
the 8th Further Notice by immediately affecting specifications for ‘innovative technologies.’”169  WISPA 
stated that “[a] 26 dBi parabolic antenna would be approximately 18 inches or more in diameter, and is 
larger than commercially available panel antennas.”170  On the other hand, API and ENTELEC 
recommended varying minimum antenna gains and power limits depending on link distance and whether 
a link serves multipoint receivers because API and ENTELEC “feel that the minimum antenna gain 
requirements should align with the communications distance sought to maximize channel re-use.”171  
While power limits depending on such factors may be appropriate as a method to reduce the likelihood of 
interference,172 we agree with the bulk of commenters that a minimum gain requirement would introduce 
an unnecessary restriction.  The proposed restriction would mean that commercially available antennas, 
which WISPA reports are smaller than a parabolic antenna with 26 dB minimum gain, would be rendered 
non-compliant.  Thus, we believe such a limit may inhibit development of a robust and affordable 
equipment market for the band that leverages commercially available antennas and technologies.  
Accordingly, we decline to adopt the minimum antenna gain proposal.
66. Construction Deadline.  The Commission proposed to require all 4.9 GHz geographic 
area licensees to place at least one base or temporary fixed station in operation within 12 months of 
license grant and to reduce the construction period for fixed P-P stations from 18 months to 12 months.173  
The Commission also included P-MP stations in this proposed requirement.174  Maryland et al., 
STARNet, and API and ENTELEC supported these proposals.175  No filer in the latest comment window 
opposed this proposal.  We believe that shortening the construction period to one year for all 4.9 GHz 
licenses will lead to more timely use of the spectrum and reduce the possibility of spectrum warehousing.  
Moreover, the change will harmonize the construction deadlines for the 4.9 GHz band with the deadlines 
of section 90.155, which is the analogous rule for the majority of part 90 radio services.176  Accordingly, 
taking into account that base stations will be licensed on a site-by-site basis rather than on geographic 
licenses as discussed above and including P-MP stations, we adopt the revised construction deadlines.
67. Robotic Use.  The Commission proposed to allow robotic use in the lowest five 
megahertz of the band, Channels 1-5.177  TDD and API and ENTELEC supported allowing robotic

operations on a coordinated basis,178 as did several public safety parties and CORF, albeit limited to 
public safety uses.179  NPSTC stated that “robotics should be allowed on other channels in the 4.9 GHz 
band as well and not be limited to channels 1-5.”180  We agree with NPSTC regarding allowed channels, 
because NPSTC contends that robotic deployments are conducted in relatively confined areas,181 which 
reduces interference concerns.  As such, there is little need to separate robotic operations spectrally from 
other uses of the band.  Accordingly, we permit robotic use throughout the band on a frequency 
coordinated basis as approved by the Band Manager.  At this time, we place no specific public safety 
eligibility limits on robotic use because we do not wish to constrain the Commission’s options to 
encourage robust non-public-safety use of the band.  Any future non-public safety robotic use of the band, 
as with other operations, would be subject to the leasing framework we seek comment on below in the 
Ninth Further Notice.
68. Power .  The Commission’s rules currently set maximum conducted output power at 33 
dBm for the widest available channel bandwidth, 20 megahertz.182  The Commission tentatively 
concluded that maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) limits should be codified in the 
rules,183 and proposed maximum EIRP limits of 65.15 dBm for P-P and 55.15 dBm for P-MP links.184  
API and ENTELEC recommended a maximum EIRP of 40 dBm for P-P links less than 8 kilometers; 60 
dBm for P-P links exceeding 8 kilometers, and 27 dBm for P-MP links.185  APCO supported allowing 
EIRP for fixed P-P and P-MP operations equivalent to part 101 levels,186 which sets a maximum 
allowable EIRP of 55 dBW (85 dBm) for frequency bands near 4.9 GHz.  WISPA suggested the 
Commission should “cap the conducted power . . . as is done in the U-NII-3 band.”187  
69. We agree with APCO that a higher EIRP limit will encourage licensees to achieve higher 
broadband data rates.188  Consequently, we set the maximum EIRP limit to match the limit under Part 101

for nearby frequency bands at 55 dBW (85 dBm).189  APCO also was “open to limiting EIRP for shorter 
paths similar to Part 101,”190 and API and ENTELEC’s suggestion regarding different power limits at 
different distances is consistent with this approach.  We agree that power should be limited for shorter 
paths to reduce the potential for interference while still permitting sufficient power for the microwave 
path.  Accordingly, because we are adopting the part 101 fixed power limit, we adopt the part 101 
“minimum” path length of 17 kilometers at which maximum EIRP is permitted, and we adopt the part 
101 power reduction rule for 4.9 GHz band path lengths shorter than 17 kilometers.191  The existing 
power limit rules remain in effect for base/mobile, mobile-only, and temporary fixed operations; albeit 
extrapolated for aggregated bandwidths larger than 20 megahertz and up to 50 megahertz.192  As with 
bandwidth and other technical parameters, requested power levels on all new applications and 
modification applications are subject to frequency coordination by the Band Manager, which may impose 
limits on a case-by-case basis as necessary to protect neighboring or overlapping users.  The Commission 
also sought comment on whether emission mask M is sufficient, or whether a tighter emission mask 
should be imposed for high power operations.193  No party commented on high power emission masks, 
and we take no further action on the emission mask M at this time.
K. 4.9 GHz Band Freeze
70. As the Commission directed in the Order on Reconsideration, the Bureaus amended the 
freeze to allow those with existing 4.9 GHz licenses to modify those licenses as permitted under the 
rules.194  Pending resolution of issues raised in the Ninth Further Notice below, we retain the freeze for all 
applicants who are not already 4.9 GHz licensees.195  The Ninth Further Notice seeks comment on a wide 
range of questions related to the implementation of our new Band Manager model, including the best 
policies as to new licensing in the band.  Issuing licenses to new licensees under the existing rules while 
these questions remain unresolved would further complicate the spectrum environment and undermine the 
Band Manager’s flexibility to provide for efficient use of this spectrum by public safety and non-public 
safety operations.  New entrants facing special circumstances may seek a waiver of the freeze pursuant to 
section 1.925 of the Commission’s rules.196
189 See 47 CFR § 101.113 (allowing a maximum EIRP of 55 dBW for the 3,700-4,200 MHz and 5,925-6,425 MHz 
frequency bands).

path lengths).
191 See 47 CFR § 101.143(b) (setting a power reduction formula of EIRP = MAXEIRP - 40*log(A/B) dBW; where: 
EIRP = The new maximum EIRP (equivalent isotropically radiated power) in dBW; MAXEIRP = Maximum EIRP 
as set forth in the Table in Section 101.113(a); A = Minimum path length from the Table above for the frequency 
band in kilometers; and B = The actual path length in kilometers.  In the 4.9 GHz band rule change we adopt today, 
MAXEIRP = 55 dBW and A = 17 kilometers).

IV. NINTH FURTHER NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING
71. In this Ninth Further Notice , we seek comment on a range of questions related to the 
implementation of our new Band Manager model for the 4.9 GHz band adopted above in the Seventh 
Report and Order.  This model will preserve the essentially public safety nature of the band while 
decreasing access costs and expanding use to a variety of primary public safety and secondary non-public 
safety operations.  
72. First, we seek comment on the Band Manager’s efforts in coordinating public safety 
operations, in particular mitigating harmful interference and modernizing operations.  Next, we seek 
comment on the Band Manager’s role in facilitating leasing to non-public safety users; how to enable 
such leasing, how to manage the revenues that arise from it, and how to ensure preemption rights for 
public safety operations.  We also seek comment on the implementation of our committee-based selection 
process for the Band Manager, which mirrors the approach we have taken for selecting clearinghouses 
and transition coordinators in a number of other bands.  Finally, we seek comment on our oversight of the 
Band Manager and on other issues related to the implementation of the Band Manager model.   
A. Rights and Responsibilities of the Nationwide Band Manager Regarding Public 
Safety Operations
73. We seek comment on the rights and responsibilities of the Band Manager with regards to 
the coordination and management of public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band.  We believe that the 
Band Manager, which need not necessarily be a public safety entity itself, at a minimum, must be 
representative of all eligible licensees in the 4.9 GHz band to ensure that, in coordinating the band and 
enabling non-public safety access, the Band Manager is knowledgeable and its judgment is impartial.197  
This representativeness, familiarity, and impartiality will help the Band Manager work with public safety 
licensees and non-public safety users to maximize efficient use of the 4.9 GHz band.  
74. We also believe that the Band Manager must have a complete, accurate, and current 
knowledge of the 4.9 GHz band environment.  This would mean that the Band Manager would be able to 
competently perform frequency coordination, understand and ensure compliance with our interference 
rules, and control use of the spectrum so as to facilitate protection for public safety.  In addition, the Band 
Manager must be familiar with all applicable Commission rules, policies, and procedures, including the 
Seventh Report and Order and any subsequent orders adopted in this proceeding.  We believe this would 
mean that the Band Manager should also have experience with ULS so that it can fulfill its role as a 
frequency coordinator for both public safety and non-public safety entities.
1. Criteria for Harmful Interference at 4.9 GHz   
75. In the Eighth Further Notice, the Commission sought comment on how to ensure public 
safety licensees have efficient and interference-free access to the band.198  In particular, it sought 
comment on the feasibility of the TIA-10 standard199 to guard against interference between licensees 
deploying fixed P-P links and P-MP hubs but also asked about an appropriate standard for licensees 
deploying non-fixed, geographic-area operations or ad-hoc temporary operations.200
197 Since 1958, the Commission has expected entities that are fulfilling the frequency coordinator role to refrain from 
discriminating amongst users and to honor all requests for coordination.  Frequency Coordination in the Private 
Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 83-737, Report and Order, 103 FCC 2d 1093, 1101-02, para. 18

76. In this Ninth Further Notice , we build off the record before us and seek comment on 
specific criteria for protecting public safety licensees operating in the band from what we term “harmful 
interference at 4.9 GHz.”201  Caltrans proposed that, “[s]hould the Commission decide to allow non-public 
safety use,” one of the “primary tasks for a nationwide Band Manager include[] Spectrum Protection [to] 
ensure that protection from harmful interference is strictly observed.”202  We agree, and thus, tentatively 
conclude that the Commission will adopt interference criteria for protecting public safety operations in the 
band from “harmful interference at 4.9 GHz” and that the Band Manager will be required to apply those 
interference criteria, once adopted, as it manages access to the band to ensure public safety licensees have 
efficient and interference-free operations in the band.  The interference criteria, once adopted, will be 
used to protect public safety incumbents from “harmful interference at 4.9 GHz” by other public safety 
licensees as well as non-public safety users in the band.  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion.  
Below we seek comment on how to define “harmful interference at 4.9 GHz.”  
77. Commenting parties uniformly supported the goal of protecting current and future public 
safety licensees from interference but differ on how to define harmful interference at 4.9 GHz and which 
interference protection approach is most appropriate.203  For instance, NPSTC stated that the threshold 
degradation approach of TIA-10 “has a demonstrated track record of ensuring interference protection for 
point-to-point fixed links.”204  TIA-10 defines threshold degradation as interference which degrades a 
victim receiver’s 10-6 bit error rate (BER) threshold by more than 1 dB.205  NPSTC noted, however, that 
TIA-10 is designed to “minimize interference to fixed operations” but indicates that “[w]hatever approach 
is ultimately adopted should protect the range of public safety operations [including mobile operations] 
from interference.”206  APCO on the other hand preferred a propagation modeling approach it uses for 
coordinating TDMA systems in the VHF band for protecting fixed P-P and P-MP systems in the 4.9 GHz 
band from interference.207  APCO prefers its approach to TIA-10 because it believes it will make 
frequency coordination “much simpler and more efficient overall.”208  Furthermore, APCO said “Part 90 
contour-based coordination” is appropriate for protecting base/mobile operations in the 4.9 GHz band.209  
WISPA stated that it believes the TIA-10 standard “is overly restrictive” and preferred a contour-based 
overlap approach similar to one used to protect Priority Access Licenses in the CBRS band from 
interference.210
78. Given the lack of consensus on a protection method, we seek further comment on how 
best to protect public safety licensees from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz.  TIA-10, as noted above, 
201 Although the term “harmful interference” is already defined under part 90, we seek comment on a specific 
definition for “harmful interference” which will apply only to the 4.9 GHz band and which will be used as the 
baseline for interference protection to public safety operations in the band.  See 47 CFR § 90.7 (defining harmful 
interference as “any emission, radiation, or induction which specifically degrades, obstructs, or interrupts the service 
provided by such stations”).

defines digital threshold to interference (T/I) as the “difference between the desired signal power 
(expressed in dBm) when the receiver is at 10-6 BER threshold and the interfering power (expressed in 
dBm) into the victim receiver which degrades the receiver threshold by 1 dB.”211  The TIA-10 standard 
notes that only the strength of the interfering signal (I) into the victim receiver must be calculated if a 
victim receiver’s desired threshold signal power (T) is known.212  It also notes that there are many ways of 
setting up the calculation, but “the results should be identical if the same parameters are used.”213  
79. Therefore, we seek comment on whether the Commission should adopt interference 
criteria to protect public safety licensees in the 4.9 GHz band in terms of digital T/I or some other 
standard?  Is T/I the proper metric to ensure protection of mission critical communications as NPSTC 
suggested?214  If so, would 1 dB of 10-6 BER threshold degradation be the proper way to provide 
sufficient interference protection to public safety?  In other words, a public safety licensee would need to 
tolerate interference that degrades its receiver’s 10-6 BER threshold level by 1 dB but would serve to 
ensure protection from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz.  Would these criteria for interference protection 
strike the right balance between allowing robust use of the band while protecting critical public safety 
communications or would it be more conservative than is necessary, as WISPA suggested?215  If it is too 
conservative, should higher levels of threshold degradation be tolerated or should a different bit error rate 
be used?  Is establishing an approach that ensures protection from harmful interference at 4.9 GHz in 
terms of digital T/I valid only when considering fixed sites?  If so, why not apply it when considering 
interference to or from mobile operations?  What criteria would be appropriate for mobile operations?
80. We also seek comment on the propagation modeling approach proposed by APCO.216  
When performing part 90 frequency coordination involving a TDMA system operating or proposing to 
operate in the VHF band, APCO and other public safety frequency coordinators comprising the Public 
Safety Communications Council (PSCC) use the Longley-Rice propagation methodology to calculate the 
strength of an unwanted signal at the receive antenna of a system being evaluated.217  The PSCC 
considers an interfering signal at the receive antenna of less than 9 dBu as passing coordination, an 
interfering signal greater than 29 dBu as failing coordination, and any value in between as needing further 
evaluation.218  Could a similar methodology be used to determine harmful interference at 4.9 GHz and, if 
so, how would harmful interference at 4.9 GHz be defined?  Would harmful interference at 4.9 GHz be 
defined in terms of the strength of an unwanted signal in dBu or dBm at the receive antenna of a station 
under consideration?  If so, what unwanted signal level would be considered to cause harmful interference 
at 4.9 GHz?  Would this methodology allow for robust use of the band while protecting critical public 
safety communications?  Are there other propagation models besides Longley-Rice which could be used 
to perform interference calculations for the 4.9 GHz band?  If so, what are they and how would these 
alternate models improve the process?  Is the propagation method used by the PSCC only valid when 
considering the interference potential between fixed sites?  If so, why can it not be applied when 
considering interference to or from mobile operations and what methodology might be more appropriate

for mobile operations?  Commenting parties who support this propagation modeling approach should 
explain why it would make the frequency coordination process simpler and more efficient, as APCO 
claims, compared to the digital T/I methodology described above.219  
81. We also seek comment on contour overlap analysis as the basis for determining harmful 
interference at 4.9 GHz.  As noted above, APCO supported contour overlap analysis for frequency 
coordination if base/mobile operations are involved but offers no proposal for what contours should be 
used for determining interference protection.220  WISPA, on the other hand, suggested the -96 dBm 
contour of a public safety licensee should be protected against aggregate interference exceeding -80 
dBm.221  Would these contour levels be appropriate for establishing interference protection in the 4.9 GHz 
band under a contour overlap approach?  What method should be used to calculate the contours under this 
approach?  Would using contours simplify the process for determining interference compared to the 
methods discussed above?  Is contour overlap analysis valid only for base/mobile operations or can it also 
be used for interference analysis of fixed sites?  Is contour analysis also a valid method for determining 
interference when mobile-only or temporary fixed operations are concerned?  Further, as discussed 
previously, would interference protection based on contour overlap allow for robust use of the band while 
protecting critical public safety communications?
82. We seek comment on whether there are alternative methods not discussed above for 
establishing interference protection for public safety licensees operating in the 4.9 GHz band.  Further, 
should there be different definitions for harmful interference at 4.9 GHz based upon whether a system 
deploys fixed or mobile operations?  If so, how would interference analysis work when considering 
systems deploying different operations (for example, an incumbent deploying fixed facilities and an 
applicant seeking to license mobile operations)?  Would a better approach be to have one definition for 
harmful interference at 4.9 GHz for all deployments in the band but allow the Band Manager maximum 
flexibility to perform the interference analysis in any manner it sees fit provided the Band Manager uses 
good engineering principles (with, as noted in the Seventh Report and Order, the possibility of 
challenging this determination to the Commission)?  In any case, we request that commenting parties 
provide us with specific proposals for protecting public safety licensees from interference and to explain 
the costs and benefits of those proposals.  
83. Finally, we seek comment on whether the nationwide Band Manager should be 
responsible for establishing interference criteria for public safety operations in the band.  Is this an 
appropriate delegation of our authority to the Band Manager?  If so, what should the Commission’s role 
be resolving a dispute regarding whether the interference criteria established by the Band Manager are 
appropriate or whether a particular operation exceeds the interference criteria?  We seek comment on this 
approach. 
2. Mediation
84. In the Seventh Report and Order, we adopt a part 90 formal frequency coordination 
requirement for public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band and assign 
nationwide authority to the Band Manager to perform the coordination function.  We now seek comment 
on what role the Band Manager should play, as part of its frequency coordination duties, in mediating or 
deciding disputes if parties disagree about existing or proposed operations.  
85. For instance, if the Band Manager does play a role in mediating disputes between an 
applicant and an incumbent licensee, we seek comment on whether we should assign authority to the 
Band Manager to resolve disputes when mediation is not successful, or simply instruct it to refer matters 
to the Commission.  If the former, should the parties involved in any dispute be able to appeal the Band

221 WISPA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 18.
735Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
Manager’s decision to the Commission?  If the latter, should the Band Manager provide a recommended 
resolution when referring any unresolved dispute to the Commission?  In this regard, we seek input on 
what process would work best if the Band Manager needs to mediate disputes between parties over 
technical issues such as the potential for one user to cause interference to another user.  Has frequency 
coordination worked in other bands without the need for any formal requirement of mediation?  
86. Should the Band Manager also have a role in mediating disputes outside its frequency 
coordination duties?  For instance, should the Band Manager mediate disputes as part of its role, as 
discussed below, in facilitating the leasing of unused spectrum rights to non-public safety entities?  If so, 
would the mediation procedures described above work if the Band Manager needed to mediate disputes 
between parties over determining the availability of excess capacity for leasing from public safety to non-
public safety users?  Are there any other scenarios where the Band Manager might need to meditate 
disputes between parties, such as over the determination of which links are afforded primary status under 
our rules?
3. Evaluating Potential Integration with Broadband Networks Used by Public 
Safety
87. PSSA suggested that the nationwide Band Manager should evaluate “potential 
integration” of the 4.9 GHz band “with the Nationwide Public Safety Broadband Network.”222  Indeed, 
ten years ago, the Commission sought comment on how the 4.9 GHz band could complement the 700 
MHz public safety broadband network.223  Since that time, a number of commercial networks have 
integrated public safety operations into their broadband networks.224  Thus, we believe the time is ripe to 
consider this issue anew, but with a broader approach.  As it identifies unused spectrum in the band, we 
tentatively conclude that the Band Manager should explore opportunities to lease spectrum, through the 
leasing models described below, to operators of broadband networks used by public safety in other 
frequency bands.  We seek comment on our tentative conclusion.  
88. We seek further comment on whether the Band Manager should be able to engage with 
any broadband network providers (public safety and/or commercial) to pursue opportunities for 
integrating operations in the 4.9 GHz band with broadband networks used by public safety in other 
spectrum bands through the leasing models described below.  Would the introduction of 5G technology 
into the 4.9 GHz band provide an opportunity for integration with public safety broadband networks in 
other bands?  Are there other technologies that could be deployed in the 4.9 GHz band that also offer an 
opportunity for integration with public safety broadband networks?  What benefits would flow from 
integrating operations in the 4.9 GHz band with public safety broadband networks?  Is there existing 
statutory authority that would permit the integration of the 4.9 GHz band into public safety broadband 
networks?  If not, would integrating operations in the 4.9 GHz band with broadband networks require 
legislative or statutory action?  Finally, what requirements would ensure that the Band Manger has the 
appropriate incentives to pursue opportunities to integrate with public safety networks, including 
broadband networks, in other bands?

4. Technological Incentivization 
89. In the Seventh Report and Order, we conclude that the nationwide Band Manager should, 
as part of a spectrum plan for the band and for the benefit of any interested licensees and lessees, 
determine how best to incorporate the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G, into the 
4.9 GHz band.  Should we require that the Band Manager file its spectrum plan for review by the 
Commission?  In addition, should we require that the Band Manager complete the spectrum plan within a 
certain timeframe, such as within four to six months after the Band Manager is selected? 
90. We also seek comment on how to encourage the widespread deployment of such 
technologies in a way that would promote interoperability while also lowering equipment costs.  Should 
the Band Manager designate one or more preferred standards as part of this process, such as the 3GPP 5G 
standard, as long as the standards are not mandated and do not restrict the uses of other technologies and 
protocols, consistent with our preference to adhere to a technology-neutral policy?225  We seek comment 
on this approach.
5. Contents of Annual Reports
91. The Seventh Report and Order, adopts an annual reporting requirement that will allow 
the Commission to more effectively oversee the Band Manager, to ensure its activities advance the 
Commission’s stated goals for this band, and to provide greater transparency, certainty, and predictability 
to the 4.9 GHz band.  We now seek comment on what information should be included in those annual 
reports. 
92. We tentatively conclude that the annual reports should include detailed descriptions of 
the Band Manager’s efforts to: (1) develop a nationwide framework that maximizes use of the band; (2) 
leverage technological advancements, including 5G; (3) foster a robust equipment market and lower 
equipment costs; and (4) address non-public safety use of the band to foster innovation and investment.  
We seek comment on our tentative conclusion.  For instance, are these the proper topics for the Band 
Manager to address when reporting on the status of the band to the Commission?  Is there any other 
information that should be included in these reports by the Band Manager?
B. Rights and Responsibilities of a Nationwide Band Manager Regarding Non-Public 
Safety Operations
93. In the Seventh Report and Order above, we adopt rules that will permit the Band 
Manager to facilitate and coordinate spectrum leasing to non-public safety entities on a secondary basis.  
While public safety licensees will remain the primary users of the band, we find that our Band Manager 
coordinated leasing framework, which enables secondary access by non-public safety users subject to 
oversight and approval by the Band Manager, is the most efficient way to promote increased use of the 
4.9 GHz band.  Below, we seek comment on options for implementing this nationwide leasing program. 
1. Leasing to Non-Public Safety Entities
94. The Band Manager will be responsible for coordinating public safety and non-public 
safety access to the band, ensuring that non-public safety use does not interfere with public safety 
operations, and for adopting procedures to ensure that non-public safety operations can be pre-empted by 
authorized public safety users as needed.  We seek input on two possible means of enabling Band 
Manager-coordinated non-public safety leasing, as well as general considerations for creating an effective 
leased access model for the band, in particular, the need to ensure non-discriminatory treatment of 
potential lessees.  Under either model, we want to ensure that all potentially affected licensees, as 
225 See, e.g. , PSSA Jan. 11, 2022, Reply at 3 (stating “[t]he most effective way to accelerate the deployment of 5G 
technologies in the 4.9 GHz Band is through a nationwide licensee (and the appointment of a band manager by such 
licensee) to develop a spectrum plan for the use of 5G across the band, which would facilitate widespread 
deployment and interoperability, and lower equipment costs”); PSSA Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 9; IAFC Dec. 20,

discussed below,226 are given the opportunity to consent to the leasing arrangements and we seek 
comment on this below.  We also seek comment generally on the distribution of leasing revenues, and 
methods for ensuring that public safety users retain priority and preemption rights within the band.
95. Model 1:  Band Manager as Lessee/Sublessor.  Under Model 1, the Band Manager would 
lease spectrum access rights directly from public safety licensees and would, in turn, be permitted to 
sublease those rights to non-public safety entities.  The Band Manager would be the only entity eligible to 
lease from public safety licensees and the only entity eligible to sublease (or lease) 4.9 GHz band 
spectrum rights to non-public safety entities; the Band Manager would play the role of mandatory 
intermediary between public safety licensees and any non-public safety 4.9 GHz band user.  The Band 
Manager would be responsible for seeking to obtain leases for access to spectrum rights from all public 
safety licensees in a given area, as discussed below, meaning the Band Manager would effectively pool 
all applicable non-exclusive spectrum access rights together to form, if successful, an exclusive spectrum 
access right (which may be limited in time, frequency, or geographic area) which it would then be 
permitted to lease to non-public safety entities.  The Band Manager would be responsible for ensuring 
that any non-public safety operations fully comply with our rules on protection of, and preemption for, 
public safety operations, including by approving the specifics of lessee deployments to ensure no harmful 
interference is created.  The Band Manager’s experience with the band—and its relationship with public 
safety licensees—would be critical factors underlying its ability under this framework to maximize 
opportunities for spectrum access while avoiding negative impacts on public safety licensees.
96. We seek comment on this model, and any issues related to its implementation.  In 
particular, we seek comment on any requirements we should place on the negotiation of leases between 
the Band Manager and public safety licensees.  Should the Band Manager and public safety licensees 
have full freedom in negotiating the terms of these leasing arrangements, or should we specify certain 
terms which must be included, such as with preemption rights?  For example, should we require—or 
prohibit—terms which give a public safety licensee veto rights over the eventual lease entered into by the 
Band Manager and a non-public safety entity?227      
97. Model 2:  Band Manager as Lease Approver.  Under Model 2, public safety licensees 
would be permitted to lease directly to non-public safety entities so long as those leases are coordinated 
through and approved by the Band Manager.  All potentially affected public safety licensees that would 
have been required to lease their spectrum to the Band Manager under Model 1 would, under Model 2, be 
required to be parties to the lease to the non-public safety entity.228  
98. The Band Manager would, in this instance, be responsible for reviewing and consenting 
to lease agreements and coordinating operations, including by approving the specifics of lessee 
deployments to ensure no harmful interference is created, but would not be a party to the lease.  The Band 
Manager’s mandatory role would be limited to supervising and managing the leasing process, ensuring all 
required consents had been obtained and that the lease terms and proposed operations fully comply with 
our rules as to protection for, and preemption by, public safety operations.  While public safety licensees 
would be free to engage the Band Manager as their agent in negotiating the lease, it need not be involved 
in lease negotiations.
99. We seek comment on this model, and on the nature and requirements of the Band 
Manager’s consent to a lease proposed by a public safety licensee or group of such licensees.  Should the 
Band Manager’s consent here be limited to ensuring compliance with our rules, or should the Band 
226 See infra para. 108.
227 Potential examples include:  the licensee does not approve of the specific sublessee selected by the Band 
Manager; it objects to one or more terms of the lease; or it has concerns about the proposed non-public safety 
operations. 
228 Under Model 1, public safety agencies would only be a party to the lease to the Band Manager, not the sub-lease 
to non-public safety users. 
738Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
Manager have the right to refuse its consent for other reasons?  For example, if the Band Manager 
determines a lease would comply with all our rules, but believes an alternative non-public safety licensee 
is preferable because it has more experience with the band and its requirements, should the Band Manager 
be permitted to refuse its consent to the lease?  If the Band Manager has the right to decline to consent to 
a lease, should the parties be able to appeal to the Commission?  At a minimum, we propose that the Band 
Manager would not have the right to disapprove lease agreements for discriminatory reasons, and we seek 
comment on any appropriate reasons for which the Band Manager could refuse its consent.  Once the 
Band Manager consents to the leasing agreement, what other responsibilities should the Band Manager 
have to ensure that the parties comply with the lease agreement and the Commission’s rules?  Is the fact 
that it will not be a party to the lease agreement a concern with regards to enforcement? 
100. Implementation of the Models.  We believe both models would move the 4.9 GHz band 
forward and dramatically improve the utilization of this important mid-band spectrum.  In both cases, 
public safety licensees remain the primary users of the band and retain full control over it, with non-
public safety operations limited to areas where all relevant public safety licensees voluntarily consent.  
Both models provide a path towards enabling meaningful non-public safety access to the band, which we 
believe will drive down costs for all users and help facilitate more efficient use of this public resource. 
101. There are, however, potential advantages and disadvantages to each model and we seek 
comment on them.  Our goal is to create a consistent, nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band that 
fosters efficient use of this important mid-band spectrum, but retains public safety priority and local 
control.  To what extent do either of these models further these goals?  For example, does Model 1’s 
centralization of leasing with the Band Manager, which emphasizes nationwide consistency, potentially 
reduce local control by limiting a licensee’s right to be a party to leases with non-public safety entities?  
In contrast, will Model 2 lead to too much regional variation in leasing terms?  Are there ways to modify 
each model to more effectively achieve our goals? 
102. Similarly, is one model more or less accommodating of particular types of agreements?  
For example, shared system agreements, where a public safety entity and a non-public safety entity jointly 
build and operate a system), may be more feasible under Model 2, which allows the two entities to 
directly enter into an agreement, subject to the Band Manager’s consent.  Are there ways we can better 
enable these kinds of agreements under Model 1?  Are there advantages to encouraging a shared system 
approach?
103. While we have structured each model as a stand-alone proposal, we also seek comment 
on the possibility of implementing them simultaneously.  Can the two models operate together, where 
some leases involve the Band Manager as a party but others only require its approval?  What would be the 
result if some public safety licensees wish to lease to the Band Manager, but others wish to lease directly 
to a non-public safety entity?  Does allowing both types of agreements present different the incentives for 
the Band Manager depending on whether or not it is a party to a lease?  What other alternative models for 
leasing should we consider and why? 
104. We propose that all lease arrangements with public safety and non-public safety entities 
in the 4.9 GHz band would be generally required to comply with our secondary markets rules,229 but seek 
comment on whether any specific rules should not apply to these leases.  We also note that the secondary 
markets rules provide for a variety of leasing vehicles, each with their own regulatory requirements 
regarding the nature of the licensee’s role in the lessee’s operations.230  Should we limit the types of 
leasing arrangements that 4.9 GHz band leases may use?  For example, should we limit leasing to only 
spectrum manager leasing arrangements,231 as opposed to permitting de facto transfer leases?232  
229 See 47 CFR part 1, subpart X. 
230 See id.
231 See 47 CFR § 1.9020. 
232 See id.  §§ 1.9030, 1.9035.
739Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
Alternatively, should we create a new leasing model specific to this band, given the unique nature of the 
relationships involved in this framework?  We seek comment on these questions with regards to all types 
of 4.9 GHz band leases under both Model 1 and Model 2.  
105. Required Consents.  Regardless of the type of leasing structure we ultimately adopt, we 
propose that all potentially affected public safety licensees would be required to consent to non-public 
safety use.  This will provide confidence to public safety licensees in the ongoing primacy of their 
operations specifically, but also of public safety operations generally.  It will ensure that all non-public 
safety operations occur with the full consent of the relevant public safety licensees, making the decision 
to allow non-public safety operations fully voluntary.  Under Model 1, this consent would take the form 
of a lease from the public safety licensee to the Band Manager, and under Model 2, it would instead 
involve being a signatory to the lease of the non-public safety entity.  
106. We seek comment on this proposal, and on any alternatives to such a consent 
requirement.  Specifically, are there hold-out concerns that would undermine the utility of leasing to 
rationalize and increase the efficiency of use in the band?  Are there other ways of ensuring the primacy 
and protection of public safety use that could reduce these concerns?  We seek comment on whether we 
should have exceptions to this general consent requirement such as after a period of non-responsiveness 
or if the licensee has conditioned its consent in a manner which does not conform with our rules.  
Similarly, should we have an exception to the general consent requirement if, as discussed below, we 
require certain licensees whose license area does not overlap with the lease area to consent and they do 
not consent but the lessee and Band Manager demonstrate full protection for their operations?
107. We also note that, in many cases, public safety licensees are subject to overlapping 
jurisdiction with one another, as in the case of a state public safety agency that overlaps with city and 
county level agencies within the state.  Should the Commission take a position regarding whether each 
licensee makes its own, independent, decision as to a given lease?  For example, states might mandate 
that local and county agencies consent to any lease that a state agency has consented to; should we 
prohibit these kinds of requirements in order to preserve local control of the band in a given jurisdiction?  
Commenters proposing such requirements should address our authority to impose such a restriction, 
whether through our preemption authority or otherwise.  
108. We seek comment on how the Band Manager will determine which public safety 
licensees are “potentially affected” and therefore must consent—or be a party—to a given lease.  To what 
extent can the Band Manager use ULS to determine the relevant public safety licensees?  Alternatively, or 
in conjunction with, should the Band Manager rely solely on a licensee’s jurisdictional boundaries in 
determining the set of potentially affected public safety licensees?  Under what circumstances should 
licensees whose license area does not overlap with the lease area be required to consent?  In other words, 
if a lease area overlaps with the license areas of Licensees A and B, but merely abuts that of Licensee C, 
we propose that Licensees A and B must consent to the lease, but must Licensee C?  How should we 
define consent rights for licensees of fixed systems, as opposed to geographic area, licenses?  Must the 
Band Manager also obtain consent from a licensee who operates on defined channels but which will not 
be impacted by the proposed lease?  
109. Public safety licensees may wish to modify their systems in ways that conflict with a 
lease agreement to which they have previously agreed.  Should public safety licensees be permitted to 
withdraw consent while a lease is in effect for this reason?  While lease and consent agreements might 
directly cover this question, we seek comment on whether we should address this issue in our rules.  We 
also seek comment on whether our rules should address the ability of public safety licensees to withdraw 
consent to a lease, such as where they wish to lease to another non-public safety entity or to deploy a 
mixed-use system which conflicts with leased access.  
110. We also seek comment on how to handle consents in situations where a public safety 
licensee, which did not previously have to consent to a lease, modifies its system in a way that alters 
whether its consent is required.  For example, Licensees A, B, and C are the only licensees who must 
consent as of the date of a lease with Company Z, and all consent.  During the lease, Licensee D applies 
740Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
to modify its license in such a way that it now would be a required consenting party to the lease.  Should 
the Band Manager condition its approval of Licensee D’s modification on its consent to the lease with 
Company Z?  Or can Licensee D decline such consent?  In that case, what is the impact on Company Z’s 
lease?  We seek comment below on the related questions involving new licensees in an area with existing 
leases.233  
111. Non-Discriminatory Leasing.  We seek comment on what rules we should adopt to ensure 
the Band Manager administers leasing in a non-discriminatory manner, and to protect against potential 
conflicts of interest.234  Should these rules vary depending on what the Band Manager’s role in leasing 
might be?   
112. For purposes of Model 1, we seek comment on whether the Band Manager should be 
permitted to use the spectrum rights it leases from public safety licensees itself rather than subleasing it.  
Similarly, should it be permitted to lease to affiliated entities and, if so, should we have any specific 
obligations in such circumstances?  For example, could such agreements be subject to certain conditions, 
such as a maximum term length or being limited to situations where no non-affiliated entity will agree to 
comparable terms?
113. For purposes of Model 2, we seek comment on potential limitations on the Band 
Manager’s authority to refuse consent to a given lease.  Should the Band Manager’s authority to do so be 
limited to cases of non-compliance with our rules?  Or can the Band Manager decline consent in favor of 
an alternate lessee, subject to certain conditions?  
114. In the Seventh Further Notice, we sought comment on whether we should limit the types 
of non-public safety entities that should be eligible for leased access—for example, only CII entities.235  
Because the non-public safety access we are enabling today will be overseen by the Band Manager—an 
entity vetted and supported by public safety licensees—we do not believe restrictions on the type of non-
public safety entities eligible for leasing are necessary.  We therefore tentatively conclude we will not 
adopt rules in this regard, but seek comment on whether the Band Manager should have the flexibility to 
engage specific non-public safety users and, if so, how that potentially aligns with our rules on non-
discriminatory access. 
115. Finally, we seek comment on the Commission’s role in enforcing these non-
discrimination rules.  Should we require the Band Manager to actively report to the Commission certain 
information about leasing, and its relationship to the parties?  Or should we rely on the relevant parties to 
engage the Commission where concerns arise?  Should there be a formal right to appeal Band Manager 
decisions to the Commission?  We further seek comment on whether the Commission should oversee the 
233 See infra  para. 149.
234 See API et al. Aug. 25, 2022, Ex Parte at 2 (noting the importance of “[p]romoting access to the 4.9 GHz band 
for all eligible parties, to be defined by the FCC on a . . . non-discriminatory basis.”). 
235 Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15055, para. 64.  Commenters were split on this question, with some 
supporting such a limitation as a way of ensuring that the needs of public safety operators are respected.  See, e.g., 
TDD Nov. 29, 2021, Comments at 2-3 (stating the Commission should “incorporate parts of NPSTC’s Aug. 13, 
2021 ex parte recommendations, such as opening the band to CII for “internal operations of the nation’s utilities, 
petrochemical facilities, and transportation networks that increasingly are subject to cyber-attacks”); FPL Nov. 29, 
2021, Comments at 5-7 (supporting “a sharing regime that permits non-public safety CII users to access the 4.9 GHz 
band and agrees with the Commission that such use should not come at the expense of public safety user”).  
However, other commenters noted that such restrictions would limit the pool of available non-public safety 
operators, limiting the utility of opening the band.  See, e.g., WISPA Jan. 22, 2022, Reply at 2-6 (stating “positions 
advanced by WISPA, DSA, Federated Wireless and New America’s OTI suggests that if the equipment market will 
expand with CII, it most certainly will expand even more if eligibility includes those potential users NPSTC and 
API/ENTELEC seek to exclude from the band”); FPL Nov. 9, 2022, Ex Parte at 1.
741Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
fees charged by Band Managers and, if so, to what the nature of that oversight should be.236  For example, 
fees charged by spectrum access system administrators in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service must be 
“reasonable;”237 should we impose a similar requirement on the Band Manager? 
116. Commission Oversight.  Commission oversight of the Band Manager and any leasing 
regime must ensure that it complies with all statutory requirements.  Under either leasing model, we 
propose that the Commission’s oversight will be based on our secondary market rules.  What, if any, 
changes to our rules may be needed to implement this oversight model?  More specifically, should the 
Commission review or approve each leasing arrangement?  Alternatively, if the Band Manager 
coordinates leases, should the Commission forebear from requiring submission of leasing notifications in 
ULS?  What, if any, changes to our rules would be required to implement this oversight model?
117. Geographic-Area License.  Today, most incumbent public safety licensees hold a 
geographic-area license which generally covers the geographic area encompassing the legal jurisdiction of 
the licensee.238  Under the new licensing rules we adopt today in the Seventh Report and Order, public 
safety licensees may be issued site-based licenses for all operations which currently are authorized under 
their geographic area licenses.239  Under the newly adopted frequency coordination requirements for the 
band, all licensees, even those that retain a geographic area license, will be required to coordinate future 
deployments with the Band Manager.240  
118. We seek comment on the advantages and disadvantages of allowing all incumbent 
licensees to retain their geographic-area licenses after they have been issued site-based licenses.  Would 
allowing some or all licensees to retain their geographic licenses aid in the facilitation of leasing excess 
capacity spectrum to non-public safety users?  Are there reasons to only allow certain licensees to retain 
their geographic-area licenses for purposes of leasing excess capacity spectrum, and if so, how should 
those licensees be selected?  Should we require all other licensees in the band to surrender their 
geographic-area licenses once the licensees enter their site-based data into ULS?  How would site-based-
only licensees and commercial operators coordinate in areas near their operations and within their 
jurisdictions (and thus their former geographic licensed area), but not overlapping with their site-based 
operations?
119. Other Leasing Issues.  We seek comment on any other issues related to the 
implementation of this new leasing regime.  What, if any, changes to our rules or to incumbent licenses 
would be required?  Will existing 4.9 GHz licenses need to be modified?  What guidelines should we 
implement to ensure that the Band Manager’s work in enabling leases and reviewing leasing applications 
is a fair and informed process?  Should the Band Manager develop a process to provide non-public safety 
entities an opportunity to track the progress of their requests?  
120. We also seek comment on the extent to which the Band Manager and other parties 
involved in leased access (public safety licensees and non-public safety operators) may, by agreement, 
streamline the process by which the Band Manager oversees non-public safety operations.  For example, 
could the parties agree that the lessee may deploy without site-by-site approvals in a given area under 
certain circumstances?

742Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
121. We seek comment on how to enable leased access in areas where there is no public safety 
licensee.241  In these areas, should we grant the Band Manager the right to lease spectrum in those areas 
on its own authority?  Would such authority require issuance of a license by the Commission?  Or should 
the availability of leasing depend on a public safety entity getting a license in that geographic area?  
122. In addition, notwithstanding our decision in the Order to not require interoperability 
between public safety users in the band, we seek comment on whether the Commission should require 
interoperability for non-public safety users in the band.  We believe that such an approach could have 
multiple benefits, such as promoting more efficient use of spectrum as well as helping foster a more 
robust and innovative equipment market.  We seek comment on those views and encourage commenters 
to describe any other effects such a requirement would have on consumers or stakeholders, including 
public safety.  Are there any technical or operational challenges to adopting such a requirement?  Are 
there any alternative approaches that the Commission should consider in lieu of mandating 
interoperability for non-public safety users?
123. Finally, we seek comment on whether we should distinguish between governmental 
agencies and nongovernmental entities which hold licenses under our rules.242  We propose that the 
operations of non-governmental licensees must be fully protected by secondary non-public safety 
operations in the band, but seek comment on whether our rules on consent to leases, preemption, and 
compensation should take into account the difference in status of these entities.  Are there different 
incentives for nongovernmental licensees which justify different treatment under our leasing rules?  
Should we instead grant authority to consent to leases to the governmental entity which supported the 
licensee’s application? 
2. Distribution of Leasing Revenues and Other Payments to Licensees
124. Funding the Band Manager.  We propose that the Band Manager be funded, at least 
partially, by leasing revenues, which will enable the Band Manager to be fully independent and equipped 
to engage in the kind of complex spectrum analysis needed to enable this leasing model.  This will ensure 
that those benefiting from the non-public safety access—non-public safety users and their customers—are 
the ones supporting the access system.  We also believe this provides an incentive for the Band Manager 
to find available spectrum access opportunities wherever it can, subject to the consent of all relevant 
public safety licensees. 
125. We seek comment on this proposal.  Will the leasing revenues be sufficient to provide the 
Band Manager with both sufficient funds to cover its costs and a reasonable rate of return on its 
investment?  We also seek comment on whether this model will provide sufficient start-up funding for the 
Band Manager, since extensive work will be required prior to any leases going into effect.  Should we 
provide for advanced funding for the Band Manager, and if so, how?  Conversely, should we place a cap 
on the amount of return the Band Manager can make from leases?  If so, what should that cap be, and 
what should be done with revenues above and beyond that amount? 
126. Under Model 1 above, the Band Manager’s role in leasing provides for a direct means by 
which it can fund itself using leasing revenues.  On the other hand, under Model 2, because licensees 
make agreements directly with non-public safety lessees, there is no such direct funding source for the 
Band Manager.  We seek comment on whether the Band Manager being funded by leasing revenues is 
feasible if we permit Model 2 lease arrangements.  Should we require that a minimum percentage of lease 
revenues be allocated to the Band Manager or allow negotiations by the parties to determine the Band 
Manager’s compensation, since the Band Manager will still be required to approve all leases?  If we allow 
241 The following states/territories are not covered by a statewide license:  American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, 
the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota.
242 See 47 CFR § 90.523. 
743Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
negotiations to cover the Band Manager’s funding, should the Band Manager be able to withhold its 
consent to a lease where the parties are not providing it with sufficient funding? 
127. In the Seventh Report and Order, we determined that the Band Manager will be permitted 
to charge reasonable rates for its coordination services, the way other frequency coordinators do today.  
We seek comment on implementing this decision, specifically on any requirements we should put in place 
as to those fees, noting that the Band Manager, unlike most frequency coordinators, will have exclusive 
control over coordination services in this band.  Should we limit fees charged by the Band Manager to 
public safety licensees and applicants?  Are there other funding sources for the Band Manager that our 
rules should contemplate? 
128. Compensation to Licensees.  We also seek comment on how our rules should treat 
compensation to licensees, either directly from non-public safety operators or from the Band Manager.  
While sharing of lease revenues in Model 1, and direct payments of lease revenues in Model 2, will likely 
form the majority of payments to licensees, they are not the only form of compensation public safety 
licensees may expect.  Such compensation may include, but is not limited to:  incentive payments to 
modify spectrum use by the licensee; payments for consent to a lease; and in-kind provision of services 
by a non-public safety entity, such as sharing access to a constructed network.  Such compensation can 
incentivize public safety licensees to rationalize their operations to increase spectrum availability and to 
distribute the benefits of allowing non-public safety access to the band. 
129. That said, we emphasize that the primary purpose of this band is to host public safety 
communications.  We seek comment on how to ensure that lease revenue generation for public safety 
agencies continues to serve the public interest and our policy goals.  We tentatively conclude that any 
public safety licensee which wholly ceases their licensed public safety operations in the band would no 
longer be eligible for a license and, therefore, any lease-related compensation.  We seek comment on that 
conclusion, and on any other provisions we should consider that serve the same ends.  Should we 
alternatively require some minimum level of continued public safety operations in order to permit 
leasing?
3. Preemption
130. In the Seventh Report and Order, we ensure that public safety entities will maintain 
primary access to the 4.9 GHz band by virtue of being the only entities licensed to operate within it, while 
non-public safety users will operate in the band on a secondary basis.  We now seek comment on how to 
ensure preemption rights for public safety licensees over non-public safety users in emergency 
circumstances.  
131. As an initial matter, we tentatively conclude that the Band Manager will be responsible 
for ensuring non-public safety licensees promptly comply with any preemption request, and that 
cooperation with preemption requests must be a material clause included in any lease agreement with 
non-public safety users regardless of the leasing model eventually adopted.  We seek comment on this 
tentative conclusion, and on the role of the Band Manager in enabling preemption and ensuring 
preemption requests are honored.  Should licensees have the ability to work directly with non-public 
safety users, such as when operating a shared system which has been designed to automatically shut down 
non-public safety operations in a preemptable situation, or should we mandate that all preemption 
requests flow through the Band Manager in order to ensure full compliance with our rules?  
132. Further, we seek comment on what type of “shut down” mechanism would best enable 
public safety licensees to trigger preemption of a non-public safety user.  Should the Band Manager be 
tasked with establishing a portal through which public safety entities could provide notice of preemption 
requests?  If so, how long should the Band Manager have to initiate operational changes to impacted non-
public safety users once the Band Manager receives a preemption request?  What specific types of 
information should the Band Manager be authorized to collect from public safety entities in connection 
with preemption requests?  Would such requests require the submission of any proprietary information or 
personally identifiable information, other than contact information (e.g., name, address, phone number, 
744Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
and email address) for a point of contact at the public safety entity?  Are there any privacy concerns with 
allowing the Band Manager to collect and maintain such information?  We note that in the Citizens 
Broadband Radio Service, a Spectrum Access System (SAS) has 300 seconds to confirm suspension of 
operation of Citizen Broadband radio devices or relocate those devices to unoccupied frequencies once 
the SAS is informed that the signal of a federal system has been detected in the area.243  If the Band 
Manager has dynamic control over a given non-public safety operation in the band, would a similar 
timeframe be appropriate for a preemption request in the 4.9 GHz band?  What would be an appropriate 
timeframe if the Band Manager does not have dynamic control over non-public safety users?  Should 
there be some other means besides a notification portal for a public safety licensee to initiate a request to 
preempt non-public safety operations in a particular area?  If so, how would preemption work in that 
case?
133. Are there non-public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band that need not be subject to 
preemption requests?  For example, would P-P links need to be included in any preemption request 
involving mobile operations?  Similarly, should a preemption request apply to the entire band, or should 
the requestor identify specific band segments that need clearing?  Further, should preemption requests be 
limited in terms of geography (such as a distance radius around a licensee) and duration?  If so, what 
distance and time duration limits would be appropriate to ensure mission critical public safety licensees 
have access to the band during an emergency without unduly disrupting non-public safety operation in the 
band?  Should there also be criteria regarding what type of event justifies a preemption request?  If so, 
should the Band Manager have discretion to decide if a particular event justifies preemption of non-public 
safety operations in the vicinity of that event?  Should preemption requests for emergency events of a 
mobile or nonfixed nature, such as a vehicle pursuit, be subject to geographic and duration limits and, if 
so, what should those limits be?  
134. Finally, we seek comment on whether only certain mission-critical public safety licensees 
should have the authority to request preemption of non-public safety operations.  If so, who should decide 
which public safety agencies have preemption authority?  Should the Band Manager be tasked with 
working with each state to determine which public safety licensees have the authority to initiate a 
preemption request?  Alternatively, if every public safety licensee in the band has preemption authority, 
could that lead to excessive preemption requests making the 4.9 GHz band effectively unusable to non-
public safety users?  In other words, we seek comment on how to balance the need for public safety 
preemption versus the need to make the band attractive to non-public safety users, which we believe will 
be to the ultimate benefit of all users of the band.
C. Selection of the Band Manager
135. In the Seventh Report and Order, we establish a nationwide Band Manager and conclude 
that it will be chosen from a pool of qualified applicants by a selection committee.244  Here, we seek 
comment on the nature of the committee and its processes, and on issues related to the creation of the 
committee and the Commission’s role in ensuring its ultimate selection satisfies not only its criteria but 
also our rules.  We believe the Commission has a responsibility to ensure the selection committee process 
is competitively neutral, and we seek comment on ways to accomplish this.
136. Selection Committee Composition.  We tentatively conclude that the selection committee 
should include representatives from the public safety community.  Should the Commission direct specific 
organizations to designate a representative to serve on the selection committee, like it did in the 800 MHz 
re-banding proceeding?245  In addition to public safety representatives, should committee members be

representative of potential non-public safety users of the band, such as commercial spectrum users or 
industry associations?246  If so, which non-public safety entities are most representative of potential users, 
and thus, should designate a representative to serve on the committee?  We note that the Commission has 
recently used selection committees for clearinghouses in the 3.45 GHz247 and 3.7 GHz bands.248  Should 
the Commission model its selection committee for the 4.9 GHz band on these committees?  Alternatively, 
are the bands—or the nature of the entity being selected (a clearinghouse as opposed to a Band 
Manager)—too different to justify using substantially the same selection process?  If so, how are the 
situations different and how should such differences be reflected in the selection process? 
137. We tentatively conclude that the selection committee will be composed of an odd number 
of representatives to prevent deadlock.  We seek comment on this structure, and also on the appropriate 
number of representatives that should serve on the selection committee.  For example, the Commission 
chose nine entities in the 700 MHz proceeding and five entities in the 800 MHz proceeding.249  To aid in 
determining the appropriate selection committee size, we also seek comment on the specific number of 
representatives that should be designated from the different categories of entities, such as public safety 
and commercial users.  For example, would it be sufficient to have nine members here—five representing 
the incumbent and public safety interests and four representing the prospective lessee and non-public 
safety interests?  If not, what other interests or combinations of interests should be included?  For 
example, would a selection committee composed of an even number of representatives from both public 
safety and non-public safety entities better represent the interests present in the band?  What, if any, 
qualifications or experience should a member have in order to be selected?  Are there any factors that 
would help ensure the selection committee is neutral and balanced from a competitive standpoint? 
138. Selection Committee Procedures.  Consistent with the 3.45 and 3.7 GHz proceedings, we 
tentatively conclude that the Bureaus will release a joint public notice announcing the entities that will 
comprise the selection committee and each selected entity would then nominate one individual to serve on 
the selection committee.250  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion.
139. In addition, as in the 700 MHz proceeding, we tentatively conclude that the selection 
committee must notify the Commission of the final process by which it will review applicants for the 
Band Manager position.251  The Commission also asked the search committee in the 700 MHz proceeding 
to “ensure that the Clearinghouse meets relevant best practices and standards in its operation to ensure an 
effective and efficient transition.”252  Consistent with this requirement, the 700 MHz band search 
committee submitted to the Commission a Request for Proposal and detailed instructions for filing 
The Association of Public Safety Communications Officials-International; The Industrial Telecommunications 
Association; Southern LINC; and United Telecom Council to designate a representative). 
246 In the 700 MHz proceeding, the Commission directed nine entities, which represented a mix of incumbents in the 
band and prospective flexible-use licensees, to designate a representative to serve on a search committee.

Proposed Modification, 35 FCC Rcd 2343, 2450-52, paras. 273-283 (2020) (700 MHz Report and Order ).  In the 
3.45 GHz band, the Commission asked WTB and OMD to develop a committee process like that in the 3.7 GHz 
proceeding.  See 3.45 GHz Second Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd at 6045, para. 163.

proposals to demonstrate it was fulfilling its responsibilities.253  Should we impose similar requirements 
on the selection committee for the 4.9 GHz band?  Are there other requirements that we should impose on 
the selection committee?  For example, should we require the selection committee, once representatives 
are designated, to certify that they have reviewed and understand the Commission’s rules and 
requirements in this proceeding?  
140. We also tentatively conclude that the selection committee should proceed by consensus.  
In the event that we select an even number of committee members, or if for some other reason there is a 
deadlock, we tentatively conclude that the selection committee should inform the Bureaus so that the 
Bureaus may consider additional measures.  We seek comment on these tentative conclusions.  Further, 
we seek input on how the Bureaus should resolve the deadlock.  For example, should the Bureaus state 
that the selection committee must proceed by majority vote?  Or should the Bureaus appoint an additional 
selection committee member?  If the Bureaus must resolve deadlock, what is the appropriate resolution 
timeline?  
141. Commission Oversight of the Committee.  We propose that applications for the position 
of Band Manager will be evaluated by the selection committee on the basis of the applicant’s ability to 
satisfy eligibility criteria established by the search committee, which it will devise based on the functions 
of the Band Manager, described above in the Seventh Report and Order and this Ninth Further Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking, and any future items issued by the Commission or by the Bureaus.254  The 
Commission will then review the selection committee’s decision to confirm it satisfies those criteria and 
that the Band Manager will be able to perform its required functions.  We seek comment on this approach.  
142. We seek comment generally on what oversight role by the Bureaus is appropriate to 
ensure the proper performance by the selection committee.  We propose the committee must provide the 
Commission with its selection criteria in advance of its receipt of applications for the Band Manager 
position so that the Commission may review those criteria and advise the committee on them as 
appropriate.  We propose that prospective Band Managers would be asked to submit to the selection 
committee, in addition to their qualifications, a general description of the frequency assignment 
methodology they propose to employ and would also submit their proposed plan for coordinating in the 
band.  Should the selection committee also provide copies of all Band Manager applications to the 
Commission for its use as part of the review of the committee’s processes?  While we believe the 
selection committee will be well-equipped to evaluate applications and choose the appropriate Band 
Manager, we seek comment on ways the Commission can assist in and oversee that process. 
D. Commission Oversight
143. Beyond our oversight of the selection committee, we also seek comment on the role the 
Commission and Bureaus should play in overseeing the Band Manager’s decisions.  While the Band 
Manager will not be a licensee of the Commission, our general authority over spectrum management 
forms the basis of our oversight of the Band Manager and its operations, including ensuring it fulfills its 
functions consistent with our rules.  We therefore propose that we delegate to the Bureaus a general 
oversight responsibility, including the authority to address negligence, discrimination, or other errors or 
abuses by the Band Manager.  We seek comment on this proposal, and on any other ways of ensuring that 
any discriminatory practices or abuses are properly mitigated and/or remedied, including any penalties 
which might be appropriate in cases of violations of our rules.  
144. We additionally seek comment on oversight of the Band Manager on the basis of 
performance, such as the quality and timeliness of public safety coordination and non-public safety 
leasing recommendations.  What performance standards would be useful metrics to oversee the Band

Selection Criteria, and Application Deadlines in the 3.7-4.2 GHz Band Transition, GN Docket No. 18-122, Public 
Notice, 35 FCC Rcd 5768 (WTB 2020).
254 As discussed above in supra para. 22, the Bureaus will have authority to manage the selection committee process.  
747Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
Manager based on performance?  Specifically, what performance standards should be used when it comes 
to timeliness, such as the speed of providing a frequency recommendation, and quality, such as 
recommending the best available frequency?  To the extent performance standards are adopted, are there 
any incentives or mechanisms, such as shot clocks, that would be appropriate to ensure the Band Manager 
is meeting or exceeding those standards?  Alternatively, should the Commission only oversee the Band 
Manager’s performance when specific complaints are submitted?255
145. We could also measure the performance of the Band Manager against any responsibilities 
we ultimately adopt based on those proposed above in the qualifications section.  For example, where it 
appears that the Band Manager is not performing its duties in a manner consistent with the public interest 
obligations imposed in this proceeding, we tentatively conclude that the Commission or Bureaus may, on 
their own motion or at the public's request, conduct an inquiry into the Band Manager’s performance.256  
While we do not foresee initiating such an inquiry on the basis of isolated complaints, we anticipate 
beginning an inquiry if it appears that the Band Manager has established a pattern of failing to perform in 
accordance with the requirements adopted here or is otherwise acting contrary to the public interest.  We 
seek comment on the Commission’s role in overseeing the performance of the Band Manager.  
146. We also seek comment on whether we should impose a specific term length for the Band 
Manager’s appointment, or whether the Band Manager should instead serve until removal by the 
Commission.  What are the advantages or disadvantages of either approach?  Should a Band Manager 
whose term has expired be eligible to serve in that position again?  If so, what type of renewal showing 
should the Band Manager be required to make?
147. Finally, we seek comment on the impact of a Band Manager being removed from its 
position, whether for cause or because of the end of its term.  Should we reinstitute the selection 
committee to appoint a new Band Manager?  What are the implications for any agreements entered into 
by the Band Manager in the event the entity serving in that role changes?  Should we require that all such 
agreements specify a succession plan? 
E. Other Considerations
1. Future Licensing of the Band
148. Under the current freeze on applications for new licenses in the 4.9 GHz band, which we 
retain here pending resolution of this Ninth Further Notice, no new licensees may enter the band but 
incumbents may file to modify their licenses or to license new points in a fixed system.257  We seek 
comment on how to address future licensing of the band, given our decision to adopt a Band Manager and 
taking into consideration the variety of different implementation issues on which we seek comment today.  
149. Should the Commission fully lift the freeze and allow any eligible public safety entity to 
obtain a license in the band?  If so, what role should the Band Manager play in the issuance of new 
licenses, as opposed to simply coordinating new systems?  Going forward, how could new licensees 
impact any existing leases, either in the form of consents or the underlying lease rights?  Should new 
licensees be treated differently from incumbent licensees with regards to lease consent and revenue 
rights?  Given the potential for revenue-generation from 4.9 GHz licenses under our new leasing system, 
are there additional buildout or other requirements we should place on new licensees to avoid spectrum 
warehousing? 
150. Alternatively, should we instead require that new public safety deployments be under the 
auspices of an existing license, either an overlapping county or local jurisdiction, or pursuant to a 
255 Frequency Coordination in the Private Land Mobile Radio Services, PR Docket No. 83-737, Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, 49 Fed. Reg. 45454, 45458, para. 23 (1984).

257 See supra para. 70.
748Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
statewide license?  This would enable new, locally controlled, public safety systems to be deployed, 
subject to our frequency coordination rules and Band Manager approval, without the creation of new 
licensees and new consent rights.  Under this proposal, new systems would be treated as new 
deployments by an incumbent for purposes of protection from non-public safety operations.  Is this 
preferable to a system of new licensure?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a model? 
151. Regardless of whether we permit new licenses to be issued in the 4.9 GHz band 
generally, we propose that the Commission would allow state entities to obtain statewide licenses where 
such a license does not currently exist.258  We seek comment on this tentative conclusion, and on whether 
there is a preferable alternative to other means of allowing access to the band where it is not currently 
licensed. 
2. Aeronautical Mobile Use
152. The Commission’s existing rules prohibit aeronautical mobile operations in the 4.9 GHz 
band,259 although some aeronautical operations have been approved on a case-by-case basis via waiver.260  
Recognizing that aeronautical mobile transmissions pose a challenge to radio astronomy observatories 
(RAS),261 the Commission proposed in the Sixth Further Notice in this proceeding to allow crewed 
aeronautical mobile use for public safety purposes, not including unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), in the 
lowest five megahertz of the band with altitude and other technical limitations.262  Public safety parties, 
API and ENTLEC, FPL, and TDD supported allowing aeronautical mobile on a coordinated basis.263  
CORF opposed aeronautical mobile use, including by UAS, due to potential interference problems for 
RAS that operate in the 4950-4990 MHz band, but specified provisions to protect observatories if the 
Commission allows aeronautical mobile use.264  
153. Because we, through the Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further Notice, are 
working to adopt a comprehensive coordination framework for public safety and non-public safety use, 
258 The following states/territories are not covered by a statewide license:  American Samoa, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, 
the Northern Mariana Islands, and South Dakota.

264 CORF Nov. 26, 2021, Comments at 5-9.  Specifically, CORF supported the 5 megahertz guard band between 
aeronautical mobile and radio astronomy operations and the 1,500 foot altitude limit, conditioned on a 100 km 
exclusion zone around any observatory listed in footnotes US 385 or US161.  It also supported only allowing low 
power devices aboard aircraft, and suggested that applicants should be required to “provide a description of their 
operations to demonstrate that such operations will protect radio astronomy (and other terrestrial uses) from 
interference.”  Id. 
749Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
we defer this issue and seek comment on whether the Band Manager could coordinate potential 
aeronautical mobile use of the band.  Commenters should focus in particular on CORF’s concerns about 
interference to radio astronomy.  We seek comment on whether the Band Manager would be equipped to 
ensure any aeronautical mobile use fully protects these important operations, based on the criteria CORF 
provided in its comments.265  Should we adopt a buffer zone around radio astronomy operations (such as 
the 100km proposal by CORF)?266  Should the Band Manager be required to work with radio astronomy 
operators to ensure non-interference, or is it equipped to do so on its own?  What sorts of requirements 
should be put on the Band Manager to ensure protection for RAS from any aeronautical mobile signals?
154. The Eighth Further Notice specifically excluded consideration of UAS operations from 
the aeronautical mobile proposal.267  We seek comment on whether the new Band Manager framework 
presents new opportunities for these operations in the band.268  Should we permit UAS operations in the 
band if we allow aeronautical mobile operations generally?269  Commenters should specifically address 
concerns raised by CORF and explain why any restrictions on unmanned operations would prevent 
harmful interference to RAS.270 
3. Digital Equity and Inclusion
155. Finally, the Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for 
all,271 including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and 
others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent 
poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations272 and benefits (if any) that 
may be associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein.  Specifically, we seek comment on how 
our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well 
the scope of the Commission’s relevant legal authority.

but seeking comment on “the potential for the 4.9 GHz band to support possible future UAS payload operations”);  
Eighth Further Notice, 36 FCC Rcd at 15053, para. 60 (seeking comment on “allow[ing] manned aeronautical 
mobile, not including unmanned aeronautical systems (UAS)”).
268 See, e.g. , Letter from Ari Q Fitzgerald, Counsel to Florida Power & Light Company to Marlene Dortch, 
Secretary, FCC, WP Docket No. 07-100 (Mar. 29, 2022) (urging the Commission to permit UAS operations in the 
4.9 GHz band).
269 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has authority over matters of aviation safety, and is tasked by statute 
with the safe integration of UAS into the National Airspace System.  See 49 U.S.C. § 44802.  Accordingly, any 
potential UAS operation permitted in the 4.9 GHz band would be subject to applicable FAA rules.
270 For example, it may be desirable to restrict UAS operation to specific use cases to minimize interference 
potential.
271 Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended provides that the FCC “regulat[es] interstate and 
foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make [such service] available, so far as possible, to 
all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or 
sex.”  47 U.S.C. § 151.
272 The term “equity” is used here consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, 
and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have 
been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons 
otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  See Exec. Order No. 13985, 86 Fed. Reg. 7009,

V. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
156. Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis.  This Seventh Report and Order may contain new or 
modified information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 
Public Law 104-13.  All such requirements will be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for review under Section 3507(d) of the PRA.  OMB, the general public, and other Federal 
agencies will be invited to comment on any new or modified information collection requirements 
contained in this proceeding.  In addition, we note that pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief 
Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4), we previously sought specific comment on 
how the Commission might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns 
with fewer than 25 employees. 
157. In this present document, we have assessed the effects of our creation of a new Band 
Manager and the collection of new granular licensing information, as well as the new technical rules for 
the 4.9 GHz band, and find that they will have a small impact on small governmental entities which are 
currently 4.9 GHz licensees, mainly related to the collection of data about existing 4.9 GHz deployments. 
158. This Ninth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking may contain new or modified 
information collection(s) subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.273  All such new or modified 
information collection requirements will be submitted to OMB for review under section 3507(d) of the 
PRA.  OMB, the general public, and other federal agencies are invited to comment on any new or 
modified information collection requirements contained in this proceeding.  In addition, pursuant to the 
Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002,274 we seek specific comment on how we might “further 
reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.”275 
159. Regulatory Flexibility Act.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA)276 
requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for notice and comment rulemakings, 
unless the agency certifies that “the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.”277  Accordingly, the Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) concerning the potential impact of the rule and policy changes adopted in the 
Seventh Report and Order on small entities.  The FRFA is set forth in Appendix D.
160. We have also prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) concerning the 
potential impact of rule and policy change proposals in the Ninth Further Notice on small entities.  The 
IRFA is set forth in Appendix E. 
161. Congressional Review Act.  The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of 
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, concurs, that this 
rule is non-major under the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 804(2).  The Commission will send a 
copy of the Seventh Report and Order to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A).
162. Ex Parte Presentations .  The proceeding shall be treated as a “permit-but-disclose” 
proceeding in accordance with the Commission’s ex parte rules.  Persons making ex parte presentations 
must file a copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral presentation within 
two business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the Sunshine period

presentation must:  (1) list all persons attending or otherwise participating in the meeting at which the ex 
parte presentation was made, and (2) summarize all data presented and arguments made during the 
presentation.  If the presentation consisted in whole or in part of the presentation of data or arguments 
already reflected in the presenter’s written comments, memoranda or other filings in the proceeding, the 
presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, memoranda, or 
other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or arguments can be 
found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum.  Documents shown or given to Commission 
staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte  presentations and must be filed 
consistent with rule 1.1206(b).  In proceedings governed by rule 1.49(f) or for which the Commission has 
made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and memoranda summarizing 
oral ex parte presentations, and all attachments thereto, must be filed through the electronic comment 
filing system available for that proceeding, and must be filed in their native format (e.g., .doc, .xml, .ppt, 
searchable .pdf).  Participants in this proceeding should familiarize themselves with the Commission’s ex

8. Add § 90.1217 to subpart Y to read as follows:
§ 90.1217 4.9 GHz Band Manager.
The 4.9 GHz Band Manager will have the following three primary responsibilities:
(a)  Frequency coordination for public safety applications;  
(b) Incentivizing the use of the latest commercially available technologies, including 5G; and
(c) Facilitating non-public safety use of the 4.9 GHz band.
760Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
APPENDIX C
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was incorporated in the Eighth Further Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (Eighth FNPRM) in October 2021.2  The Commission sought written public comment on the 
proposals in the Eighth FNPRM, including comments on the IRFA.  No comments were filed addressing 
the IRFA.  This present Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) conforms to the RFA.3  
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Final Rules
2. In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission takes a number of actions to advance 
its goals for a comprehensive and integrated approach to the 4.9 GHz band which emphasizes public 
safety needs while spurring innovation and driving down costs in the band.  As an initial matter, the 
Commission establishes a nationwide Band Manager which will coordinate public safety operations in the 
band, ensuring protection of public safety operations, and promoting more efficient use of spectrum 
resources while facilitating non-public safety use of the band through spectrum leasing.  The Commission 
also adopts its proposal to collect more granular data on public safety deployments in the Commission’s 
Universal Licensing System (ULS) and provide incumbent licensees a one-year period to submit the 
necessary technical detail.  Furthermore, the Commission adopts formal frequency coordination 
procedures for public safety applicants seeking to license new or modify existing facilities in the band and 
assigns authority to the Band Manager to perform the frequency coordination function.  Additionally, the 
Commission adopts certain technical rules it sought comment on in the Eighth Further Notice to increase 
use of the band while declining to adopt technical standards to promote interoperability or a spectrum 
management role for Regional Planning Committees (RPCs).  Finally, the Commission retains the freeze 
for all applicants who are not already 4.9 GHz licensees.  Consequently, the rules we adopt in the Seventh 
Report and Order further our goal to maximize use of the 4.9 GHz band to support public safety while 
opening the door for limited non-public safety use and a more robust equipment market.
B. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA
3. There were no comments filed that specifically addressed the proposed rules and policies 
presented in the IRFA. 
C. Response to Comments by Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration
4. Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which amended the RFA, the 
Commission is required to respond to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the 
Small Business Administration (SBA), and to provide a detailed statement of any change made to the 
proposed rules as a result of those comments.4
5. The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this 
proceeding.
1 See 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, (SBREFA) Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

D. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules Will 
Apply
6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the rules adopted herein.5  The RFA generally defines 
the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” 
and “small governmental jurisdiction.”6  In addition, the term “small business” has the same meaning as 
the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.7  A “small business concern” is one 
which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) 
satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).8
7. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions .  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.9  First, while there 
are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, 
according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent 
business having fewer than 500 employees.10  These types of small businesses represent 99.9% of all 
businesses in the United States which translates to 32.5 million businesses.11
8. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”12  The 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.13  Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there 
were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less 
according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.14
5 See 5 U.S.C. § 604(a)(4).
6 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).
7 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small-business concern” in the Small Business 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”
8 15 U.S.C. § 632.
9 See 5 U.S.C. § 601(3)-(6).
10 See SBA, Office of Advocacy, Frequently Asked Questions, “What is a small business?,” 
https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03093005/Small-Business-FAQ-2021.pdf. (Nov 2021).
11 Id.
12 5 U.S.C. § 601(4).
13 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small 
organizations in this small entity description.  See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard), "Who must file,"
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations-
form-990-n-e-postcard.  We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt 
organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field.
14 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF), “CSV Files by Region,” 
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf.  The IRS 
Exempt Organization Business Master File (EO BMF) Extract provides information on all registered tax-
exempt/non-profit organizations.  The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO 
BMF data for businesses for the tax year 2020 with revenue less than or equal to $50,000 for Region 1-Northeast 
(continued….)
762Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
9. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”15  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census 
of Governments16 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.17  Of this number there were 
36,931 general purpose governments (county18, municipal and town or township19) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts20 with enrollment 
populations of less than 50,000.21  Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data, we 
estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”22
10. Frequency Coordinators.  Frequency coordinators are entities or organizations certified 
by the Commission to recommend frequencies for use by licensees in the Private Land Mobile Radio 
Services (PLMR) that will most effectively meet the applicant's needs while minimizing interference to 
licensees already operating within a given frequency band.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA have 
developed a small business size standard specifically applicable to spectrum frequency coordinators. 
Area (58,577), Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas (175,272), and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast 
Areas (213,840) that includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.  This data does not include information for 
Puerto Rico.
15 5 U.S.C. § 601(5).
16 See 13 U.S.C. § 161.  The Census of Governments survey is conducted every five (5) years compiling data for 
years ending with “2” and “7”.  See also Census of Governments, https://www.census.gov/programs-
surveys/cog/about.html. 
17 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments – Organization Table 2. Local Governments by Type and 
State: 2017 [CG1700ORG02].  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html. Local 
governmental jurisdictions are made up of general-purpose governments (county, municipal and town or township) 
and special purpose governments (special districts and independent school districts).  See also Table 2. 
CG1700ORG02 Table Notes_Local Governments by Type and State_2017. 
18 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments - Organization, Table 5. County Governments by 
Population-Size Group and State: 2017 [CG1700ORG05].  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-
governments.html. There were 2,105 county governments with populations less than 50,000.  This category does not 
include subcounty (municipal and township) governments.  
19 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments - Organization, Table 6. Subcounty General-Purpose 
Governments by Population-Size Group and State: 2017 [CG1700ORG06]. 
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  There were 18,729 municipal and 
16,097 town and township governments with populations less than 50,000. 
20 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments - Organization, Table 10. Elementary and Secondary 
School Systems by Enrollment-Size Group and State: 2017 [CG1700ORG10].  
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  There were 12,040 independent school 
districts with enrollment populations less than 50,000.  See also Table 4. Special-Purpose Local Governments by 
State Census Years 1942 to 2017 [CG1700ORG04], CG1700ORG04 Table Notes_Special Purpose Local 
Governments by State_Census Years 1942 to 2017.
21 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census 
of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments 
category.  Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments 
category.
22 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of 
Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10.

interests of their member, is the closest applicable industry with a SBA small business size standard.24  
11. The SBA small business size standard for Business Associations classifies firms with 
annual receipts of $8 million or less as small.25  For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show 
that there were 14,540 firms that operated for the entire year.26  Of these firms, 11,215 had revenue of less 
than $5 million.27  Based on this data, the majority of firms in the Business Associations industry can be 
considered small.  However, the Business Associations industry is very broad and does not include 
specific figures for firms that are engaged in frequency coordination.  Thus, the Commission is unable to 
ascertain exactly how many of the frequency coordinators are classified as small entities under the SBA 
size standard.  According to Commission data, there are 13 entities certified to perform frequency 
coordination functions under Part 90 of the Commission’s rules.28  For purposes of this FRFA the 
Commission estimates that a majority of the 13 FCC-certified frequency coordinators are small
12. Private Land Mobile Radio Licensees.  Private land mobile radio (PLMR) systems serve 
an essential role in a vast range of industrial, business, land transportation, and public safety activities.  
Companies of all sizes operating in all U.S. business categories use these radios.  Wireless 
Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite) 29 which encompasses business entities engaged in 
radiotelephone communications, is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard 
applicable to these services.  The SBA small size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if 
it has 1,500 or fewer employees.30  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms 
that operated in this industry for the entire year.31  Of this number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250

27 Id. The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that 
meet the SBA size standard.  We note that the U.S. Census Bureau withheld publication of the number of firms that 
operated with sales/value of shipments/revenue in the individual category for less than $100,000, to avoid disclosing 
data for individual companies (see Cell Notes for the sales/value of shipments/revenue in this category).  Therefore, 
the number of firms with revenue that meet the SBA size standard would be higher than noted herein. We also note 
that according to the U.S. Census Bureau glossary, the terms receipts and revenues are used interchangeably, see 
https://www.census.gov/glossary/#term ReceiptsRevenueServices . 
28 The Commission’s records indicate that there are currently 13 frequency coordinators that would be affected by 
this rulemaking.  See https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/industrial-business/industrial-

employees.32  Thus under the SBA size standard, the Commission estimates licensees in this industry can 
be considered small.
13. Based on Commission data as of December 14, 2021, there are approximately 387,370 
active PLMR licenses.33  Active PLMR licenses include 3,577 licenses in the 4.9 GHz band;34 19,011 
licenses in the 800 MHz band;35 and 2,716 licenses in the 900 MHz band.36  Since the Commission does 
not collect data on the number of employees for licensees providing these services, at this time we are not 
able to estimate the number of licensees with active licenses that would qualify as small under the SBA’s 
small business size standard.  Nevertheless, the Commission believes that a substantial number of PLMR 
licensees are small entities.
14. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment 
Manufacturing.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and 
television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.37  Examples of products made by these 
establishments are: transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, 
pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and 
broadcasting equipment.38  The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses 
having 1,250 employees or less as small.39  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 656 
firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.40  Of this number, 624 firms had fewer than 250

employees.41  Thus, under the SBA size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered 
small.
15. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.42  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.43  The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 
1,500 or fewer employees.44  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this 
industry that operated for the entire year.45  Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 
employees.46  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, 
as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
wireless services.47  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer 
employees.48  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers can be 
considered small entities. 
E. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities
16. Band Manager.  In the Seventh Report and Order , the Commission adopted a single, 
nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band, that is centered around a new Band Manager, which will be 
equipped with additional information about the current public safety use of the band and empowered to 
work with public safety licensees to ensure efficient use of this spectrum and enable new, non-
commercial operations on a secondary, preemptable basis.  Once selected, the Band Manager will have 
three primary responsibilities: (1) frequency coordination; (2) incentivizing the use of the latest 
commercially available technologies, including 5G; and (3) facilitating secondary non-public safety use.
17. Licensing Database .  In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission adopts a 
requirement to collect more granular data on public safety deployments in ULS.  We require small and 
other incumbent licensees and future applicants to supply complete microwave path data for fixed links, 
and to license base stations (currently authorized under the geographic license scheme) on a site-by-site 
basis.  Specifically, we require applicants for and current licensees of point-to-point (P-P), point-to-
multipoint (P-MP), and fixed receivers to provide the following information: transmitter and receiver 
antenna coordinates, azimuth (direction), polarization, beamwidth, physical dimensions, gain, and height 
above ground, as well as transmit details such as power, channel, bandwidth, and emissions.  These 
requirements are consistent with existing Commission microwave radio service rules. We require

applicants for and current licensees of base/mobile operations to provide the following information: 
coordinates (base), height above average terrain (base), number of units (mobile), mobile area of 
operation, power, channels, and emissions.  These requirements are consistent with existing Commission 
private land mobile radio service rules.
18. The Commission directed the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to make necessary enhancements to ULS and announce by public 
notice when ULS is prepared to accept more granular data on public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz 
band.  Incumbent licensees and future applicants seeking to license point-to-point, point-to-multi-point, 
and fixed receivers as well as base/mobile, mobile-only or temporary fixed operations are required to use 
FCC Form 601.  There will not be any application fees associated with this information collection for 
public safety entities because they are exempt from application fees pursuant to 47 CFR § 1.1116(b).
19. The Seventh Report and Order gives incumbent geographic licensees one year to identify 
and submit the necessary technical data into the ULS, including P-P links, P-MP hubs, fixed receivers, 
base stations, and mobiles that are not currently licensed site-by-site.  We believe that collecting this data 
will improve the level of interference protection licensees receive in the band; and will create a more 
predictable and transparent spectrum environment for any current and future users of the band, including 
potential non-public safety users.  The Commission estimates the average burden for each applicant 
completing FCC Form 601 and associated schedules to be 1.25 hours, which includes “the time to read 
the instructions, look through existing records, gather and maintain required data, and actually complete 
and review the form or response.”49 
20. Frequency Coordination.  In the Seventh Report and Order, the Commission adopts a 
part 90 formal frequency coordination requirement for public safety applicants seeking to license facilities 
in the 4.9 GHz band and assigns nationwide authority to the Band Manager to perform the coordination 
function.  Specifically, the Band Manager will review applications from public safety entities seeking to 
license facilities in the 4.9 GHz band before they are filed with the Commission.  It will perform an 
interference analysis and recommend to applicants the most appropriate channel(s), bandwidth, operating 
power, area of operation (if mobile or temporary fixed operation is requested), or any other technical 
criteria which promotes robust use of the band while minimizing interference to incumbent licensees.  
Furthermore, once a Band Manager is in place, all applications filed with the Commission via ULS which 
seek to license new facilities or modify existing facilities in the 4.9 GHz band must include a showing of 
frequency coordination by the Band Manager.  Finally, we allow the Band Manager to outsource the 
interference analysis portion of its frequency coordination duties to third parties. 
21. Non-Public Safety Use of the Band.  We amended our rules in the Seventh Report and 
Order to allow non-public safety use of the band by small and other non-public safety operators as 
authorized by the Band Manager.  Non-public safety operations are required to fully protect and, when 
necessary, abide by preemption rules regarding the public safety operations which will remain the 
primary use of the band.  Non-public safety operators will not be licensed.  Licensed operations will 
remain exclusively in support of public safety.  Further, the Band Manager will centrally coordinate non-
public safety access and will create a standardized set of rules and contractual provisions for such access 
by small and other non-public safety operators, which will ensure that public safety retains priority and 
preemption rights.   
F. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
22. The RFA requires an agency to provide, “a description of the steps the agency has taken 
to minimize the significant economic impact on small entities . . . including a statement of the factual, 
policy, and legal reasons for selecting the alternative adopted in the final rule and why each one of the 
49 See FCC Form 601 at 1, available at https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/fcc-form-601.pdf.
767Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
other significant alternatives to the rule considered by the agency which affect the impact on small entities 
was rejected.”50
23. The Commission’s actions in the Seventh Report and Order  require small and other 
public safety incumbents and future applicants for the 4.9 GHz band to submit more granular data on FCC 
Form 601, however, the economic impact will be minimized since, as noted above, there aren’t any 
application fees associated with filing this information in the ULS.  We have also taken steps to minimize 
the burden of submitting the data by collecting the technical information on forms which licensees in the 
public safety community are already familiar with because they use these same forms to file license 
applications in other frequency bands.  Furthermore, we provide small and other incumbent licensees a 
one-year period to submit the necessary technical details into the ULS.  As we note in the Seventh Report 
and Order, collecting the additional technical data on public safety operations will benefit public safety 
licensees operating in the band because it will improve interference protection and give public safety 
licensees more confidence in the band without adding a significant burden on licensees or applicants to 
submit the data.
24. While small and other public safety applicants seeking to license facilities in the 4.9 GHz 
band will be subject to formal frequency coordination procedures, the economic impact will be minimized 
since we adopt a frequency coordination process which public safety licensees operating PLMR facilities 
in other frequency bands are familiar.  Once in place, the formal frequency coordination process will 
ensure the efficient assignment and use of spectrum by public safety licensees while minimizing 
interference to incumbent public safety licensees.  Consequently, the frequency coordination process will 
improve interference protection and give public safety licensees more confidence in the band without 
adding a significant burden on applicants.
25. The Commission considered but declined to adopt a more active form of frequency 
coordination for public safety operations in the 4.9 GHz band, such as the automated frequency 
coordination in the 6 GHz band or the spectrum access system that facilitates dynamic spectrum sharing 
in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).  No comments were filed specifically addressing the 
costs associated with more active forms of frequency coordination, both in terms of setup and 
implementation going forward, compared to traditional part 90 frequency coordination.  Thus, given the 
lack of record on costs associated with more active forms of frequency coordination, and the likelihood of 
considerable disruption to small and other incumbent licensees caused by the need to upgrade or replace 
all of their equipment currently in use, the Commission determined the public interest is best served by 
adopting the part 90 frequency coordination framework which does not require any modification of or 
replacement to equipment currently in use in the band
26. In the Seventh Report and Order we also declined to adopt a spectrum management role 
at 4.9 GHz for RPCs given the lack of necessary funding and resources for RPCs nationwide, the lack of 
expertise in the types of technology likely to be deployed in the band, and a lack of consensus in the 
record that regional planning is consistent with our goal of establishing a national framework for the 
band.  This decision imposes zero burdens and costs and thus imposes no significant economic impact on 
RPCs and the NRPC, all of which we estimate to be small entities.
27. Further, we believe our decision to allow small and other non-public safety operators use 
of the 4.9 GHz band as detailed in the Seventh Report and Order will provide economic benefits for small 
entities and strikes the proper balance between allowing localized control of 4.9 GHz band operations by 
public safety licensees and reducing interference, while also ensuring consistent, nationwide rules that 
will promote overall spectral efficiency, foster innovation, and drive down equipment costs.
28. Finally, the Commission also considered but declined to: (1) impose an interoperability 
standard in light of the wide variety of uses and potential uses of the band, imposing such standards at this 
juncture could lead to fewer equipment options thereby potentially stifling innovation and contradicting 
50 5 U.S.C. § 604(a)(6).
768Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
our goal of reducing equipment costs; (2) adopt our proposal to limit temporary P-P operations to thirty 
days maximum over a given path over a one-year period because such a limitation would limit flexibility 
in the band, and (3) adopt our proposal to require a minimum antenna gain for P-P antennas because 
commercially available antennas would be rendered non-compliant such a limitation could inhibit 
development of a robust and affordable equipment market for the band that leverages commercially 
available antennas and technologies.
G. Report to Congress 
29. The Commission will send a copy of the Seventh Report and Order and Ninth Further 
Notice , including this FRFA, in a report to Congress pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.51  In

APPENDIX D
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the Ninth 
Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Ninth Further Notice).  Written public comments are requested 
on this IRFA.  Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines 
for comments as specified in the Ninth Further Notice.  The Commission will send a copy of the Ninth 
Further Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the Ninth Further Notice and IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be 
published in the Federal Register.3
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules
2. Having decided in the Seventh Report and Order that a nationwide Band Manager for the 
4.9 GHz band is the best option for moving forward on a comprehensive nationwide, coordinated 
approach to the band, in the Ninth Further Notice the Commission seeks comment on the tentative 
conclusions, proposals and inquiries we put forth addressing the rights and responsibilities of the 
nationwide Band Manager regarding public safety and non-public safety operations, selection of the Band 
Manager, Commission oversight of the Band Manager and other considerations involving licensing and 
use of the band.  More specifically, we seek comment in the Ninth Further Notice on an interference 
criteria for the Band Manager to apply as part of its frequency coordination duties.  We also seek 
comment on the Band Manager mediating disputes, evaluating potential integration of the 4.9 GHz band 
with broadband networks used by public safety in other frequency bands, and facilitating the leasing of 
unused spectrum rights to non-public safety entities which includes two possible leasing models that 
could be implemented.  We further seek comment on our proposals regarding the applicable rules for 
leasing arrangements, the required consents for non-public safety use of the band, funding of the Band 
Manager primarily by leasing revenues, allowing the Band Manager to charge licensees and applicants 
reasonable rates for its coordination services and the eligibility criteria to be used by the selection 
committee in its evaluation process for Band Manager applicants.
3. Finally, we seek comment on ensuring preemption rights for public safety licensees over 
non-public safety users, qualifications for any entity seeking the Band Manager position, a selection 
committee to select the Band Manager, the role of the Commission in overseeing the Band Manager as 
well as the contents of annual reports from the Band Manager, on future public safety licensing of the 
band and on aeronautical mobile use of the band.  
4. In seeking comment on these issues, we believe the Commission can implement a 
nationwide framework for the 4.9 GHz band which ensures public safety operations continue to be 
prioritized while opening the band to additional users which will facilitate increased use of the band, 
encourage a more robust market for equipment and greater innovation, and at the same time protect public 
safety users from harmful interference.
B. Legal Basis
5. The proposed action is authorized pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 4(o), 301, 303(b), 
303(g), 303(r), 316, 332, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151,

C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rules Will Apply
6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules and policies, if adopted.4  The 
RFA generally defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” 
“small organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”5  In addition, the term “small business” has 
the same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.6  A “small 
business concern” is one which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field 
of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.7
7. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.8  First, while there 
are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, 
according to data from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy, in general a 
small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.9  These types of small 
businesses represent 99.9% of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million 
businesses.10
8. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”11 The 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.12  Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there 
were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less 
according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.13 
4 5 U.S.C. § 603(b)(3).
5 See id . § 601(6).
6 See id . § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small-business concern” in the Small Business Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

11 See 5 U.S.C. § 601(4).
12 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction. Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small 
organizations in this small entity description.  See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard), "Who must file,"
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-organizations-
form-990-n-e-postcard.  We note that the IRS data does not provide information on whether a small exempt 
organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field.

9. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”14  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census 
of Governments15 indicate that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16  Of this number there were 
36,931 general purpose governments (county17, municipal and town or township18) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments - independent school districts19 with enrollment 
populations of less than 50,000.20  Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data, we 
estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”21
10. Private Land Mobile Radio Licensees.  Private land mobile radio (PLMR) systems serve 
an essential role in a vast range of industrial, business, land transportation, and public safety activities.  
Companies of all sizes operating in all U.S. business categories use these radios.  Wireless 
Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite) 22 which encompasses business entities engaged in 
exempt/non-profit organizations. The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO 
BMF data for businesses for the tax year 2020 with revenue less than or equal to $50,000, for Region 1-Northeast 
Area (58,577), Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas (175,272), and Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast 
Areas (213,840) which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.  This data does not include information 
for Puerto Rico.

State: 2017 [CG1700ORG02],  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  Local

with populations less than 50,000.  This category does not include subcounty (municipal and township) 
governments.  
18 See id. at tbl.6.  Subcounty General-Purpose Governments by Population-Size Group and State: 2017

20 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census 
of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments 
category.  Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments 
category.
21 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of

radiotelephone communications, is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard 
applicable to these services.  The SBA small size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if 
it has 1,500 or fewer employees.23  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms 
that operated in this industry for the entire year.24  Of this number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 
employees.25  Thus under the SBA size standard, the Commission estimates licensees in this industry can 
be considered small.
11. Based on Commission data as of December 14, 2021, there are approximately 387,370 
active PLMR licenses.26  Active PLMR licenses include 3,577 licenses in the 4.9 GHz band;27  19,011 
licenses in the 800 MHz band;28 and 2,716 licenses in the 900 MHz band.29  Since the Commission does 
not collect data on the number of employees for licensees providing these services, at this time we are not 
able to estimate the number of licensees with active licenses that would qualify as small under the SBA’s 
small business size standard.  Nevertheless, the Commission believes that a substantial number of PLMR 
licensees are small entities.
12. Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment 
Manufacturing.  This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing radio and 
television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.30  Examples of products made by these 
establishments are: transmitting and receiving antennas, cable television equipment, GPS equipment, 
pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and

broadcasting equipment.31  The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies businesses 
having 1,250 employees or less as small.32  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 656 
firms in this industry that operated for the entire year.33  Of this number, 624 firms had fewer than 250 
employees.34  Thus, under the SBA size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered 
small.
13. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.35  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.36  The SBA size standard for this industry classifies a business as small if it has 
1,500 or fewer employees.37  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 2,893 firms in this 
industry that operated for the entire year.38  Of that number, 2,837 firms employed fewer than 250 
employees.39  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report, 
as of December 31, 2020, there were 797 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of 
wireless services.40  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 715 providers have 1,500 or fewer 
employees.41  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers can be 
considered small entities.  
D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities
14. The Ninth Further Notice may impose new or additional reporting or recordkeeping 
and/or other compliance obligations on small entities, if adopted.  Based on Commission proposals in the 
Ninth Further Notice, small and other entities are likely to be subject to the requirement that all lease 
arrangements between public safety and non-public safety entities in the 4.9 GHz band comply with our 
secondary markets rules, if our proposal is adopted.  Small and other entities are also likely to be subject

to compliance with our proposed requirement that all relevant public safety licensees must to consent to 
non-public safety operator use, if adopted.  
15. We also seek comment on what role, if any, public safety licensees should have in 
reviewing and approving lease agreements being negotiated by the Band Manager.  In particular, we seek 
comment on the benefits and costs of different models of licensee involvement in the leasing process.  
Further, we seek comment whether the Commission should permit the Band Manager to limit the 
categories of entities eligible for leased access, or whether such limitations would be contrary to the 
Commission’s goals of ensuring fair access and efficient use of spectrum.  The resolution of each of these 
matters may result in additional compliance obligations for small and other entities operating in the 4.9 
GHz band.  
16. In assessing the cost of compliance for small entities, at this time the Commission is not 
in a position to determine whether, if adopted, the proposals and matters upon which we seek comment 
will require small entities to hire professionals to comply and cannot quantify the cost of compliance with 
any of the potential rule changes that may be adopted.  We expect the information we received in 
comments including where requested, cost and benefit analyses, to help the Commission identify and 
evaluate relevant compliance matters for small entities, including compliance costs and other burdens that 
may result from the proposals and inquiries we make in the Ninth Further Notice.
E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
17. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business,  
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following 
four alternatives (among others ):  “(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting 
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the 
clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for 
such small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather than design, standards; and (4) an exemption from 
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.”42
18. Parties in the proceeding uniformly supported the goal of protecting current and future 
public safety licensees from interference but differ on how to define interference and which interference 
protection approach is most appropriate.  Therefore, rather than imposing a standard on its own which 
could adversely impact small entities, in the Ninth Further Notice  the Commission seeks further comment 
on specific criteria for protecting public safety licensees operating in the band from interference.  Based 
on comments, we considered and seek comment on these alternative approaches, the threshold 
degradation approach of TIA-10, a propagation modeling approach used by part 90 frequency 
coordination for TDMA systems operating in the VHF band or contour overlap analysis as the basis for 
determining interference to public safety licensees operating in the 4.9 GHz band.  In each case, we seek 
comment on whether the interference protection criteria would strike the right balance between allowing 
robust use of the band while protecting critical public safety communications.  Further, in the Ninth 
Further Notice we invite the submission of other approaches and proposals with cost and benefit analyses 
to establish protection for public safety licensees operating in the 4.9 GHz band.
19. In the Ninth Further Notice, we also seek comment on ways to enable the Band Manager 
to facilitate the leasing of unused spectrum rights to non-public safety entities.  We propose that all 
relevant public safety licensees would be required to consent to this arrangement but considered and seek 
comment on alternatives such as whether we should have exceptions to this general requirement and 
allow leasing in the absence of a given licensee’s consent, for example after a period of non-
responsiveness or if the licensee has conditioned its consent in a manner which violates our rules on 
compensation.  Or whether we should have an exception for lack of consent if, we require certain 
licensees whose license area does not overlap with the lease area to consent.  
42 5 U.S.C. § 604(a)(6).
775Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-3
20. To safeguard small and other entities from discriminatory treatment, we seek comment in 
the Ninth Further Notice  on what rules should be imposed on the Band Manager to ensure it administers 
leasing in a non-discriminatory manner.  Our inquiry for non-discriminatory leasing rules explores 
specific lessees as well as the types of lessees and the nature of the operations they will conduct with the 
4.9 GHz band.  Finally, while we propose that the Band Manager fund itself from leasing revenue, to 
minimize the impact for small and other entities we considered and seek comment on whether there are 
any requirements we should put in place as to those fees, whether we should limit the fees charged by the 
Band Manager to public safety licensees and applicants, whether there are other funding sources for the 
Band Manager that our rules should contemplate, and how to approach revenues exceeding the Band 
Manager’s costs for its services.  
21. The Commission is hopeful that the comments it receives will specifically address 
matters impacting small entities and include data and analyses relating to these matters.  Further, while 
the Commission believes the rules that are eventually adopted in this proceeding should benefit small 
entities, whether public safety licensees seeking interference protection in the band or non-public safety 
entities seeking access to valuable spectrum, the Commission expects to more fully consider the 
economic impact and alternatives for small entities following the review of comments filed in response to 
the Ninth Further Notice.  The Commission’s evaluation of this information will shape the final 
alternatives it considers, the final conclusions it reaches, and any final actions it ultimately takes in this 
proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities.

NOTICE OF APPARENT LIABILITY FOR FORFEITURE
Adopted:  January 23, 2023 Released:  January 24, 2023
By the Commission:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. We propose a penalty of $504,000 against Fox Corporation d/b/a Fox Television Stations, 
LLC; Fox Television Holdings, LLC; Fox Broadcasting Company, LLC; NW Communications of Texas, 
Inc.; NW Communications of Phoenix, Inc.; NW Communications of Austin, Inc.; New World 
Communications of Atlanta, Inc.; New World Communications of Tampa, Inc.; and New World 
Communications of Detroit, Inc. (collectively, FOX) for apparently willfully violating the Federal 
Communications Commission’s (Commission or FCC) rules that prohibit the transmission of, or causing 
the transmission of, false or deceptive emergency alert system (EAS) codes or EAS Attention Signals, or 
simulations thereof (together, EAS Tones).  On November 28, 2021, FOX apparently transmitted, or 
caused the transmission of, EAS Tones during a FOX National Football League (NFL) promotional 
segment in the absence of any actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, or qualified public service 
announcement (PSA).
2. The EAS is a national system that federal, state, and local government authorities use to 
disseminate public warnings of impending emergencies, such as hurricanes and other dangerous weather 
conditions, wildfires, and child abductions (AMBER alerts), over broadcast, cable, and satellite networks 
to consumers’ radios, televisions, and other audio and video devices.1  Broadcasters, cable television 
operators, wireless cable operators, wireline video service providers, satellite digital audio radio service 
providers, and direct broadcast satellite providers also are required to supply the communications 
capability for delivery of nationwide messages to the American public during a national emergency via 
the EAS.2
1 See Amendment of Part 11 of the Commission’s Rules Regarding the Emergency Alert System, Report and Order, 
PS Docket No. 15-94, FCC 22-75, para. 3 (released Sept. 30, 2022).

Texas LLC, CBS LITV LLC, Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, 34 FCC Rcd 8417, para. 1 (2019) (forfeiture 
paid) (CBS NAL); FEMA, Emergency Alert System, https://www.fema.gov/emergency-
(continued….)
777Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-4
3. To preserve the unique purpose and effectiveness of the EAS Tones, the Commission 
enforces laws that prohibit their use or simulation,3 except for specific Permitted Uses.4  The Commission 
has warned that the use of simulated or actual EAS Tones for non-authorized purposes—such as 
commercial or entertainment purposes—can lead to “alert fatigue,” whereby the public becomes 
desensitized to the alerts, questioning or simply disregarding whether a particular alert is intended to warn 
about a real, imminent threat or some other cause.5  Moreover, because the EAS Tones include operative 
data elements,6 the misuse of simulated or actual EAS Tones may result in false activations of the EAS 
that can spread false information or lock out legitimate activations of the EAS.  Unauthorized use of the 
EAS Tones thus undermines the integrity and effectiveness of the EAS and presents a substantial threat to 
public safety.  
4. In this Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture, we find that FOX apparently willfully 
violated section 11.45(a) of the Commission’s rules7 on November 28, 2021, when it transmitted or 
caused the transmission of EAS Tones during a FOX NFL promotional segment in the absence of any 
actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, qualified PSA, or other Permitted Uses.8  The prohibition 
on such transmissions has been in place for many years, and the Commission has repeatedly made its 
requirements clear.9  Accordingly, based on our review of the facts and circumstances surrounding this 
(Continued from previous page)  
managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/emergency-alert-system (last visited Aug. 16, 
2022).
3 A “simulation” of the EAS tones includes not only recordings of actual EAS codes or Attention Signals, see 47 
CFR § 11.31, but also sounds that mimic or are substantially similar to them, such that an average listener could 
reasonably mistake the sounds for an actual EAS code or Attention Signal.  Emergency Alert System: False, 
Fraudulent or Unauthorized Use of the Emergency Alert System Attention Signal and Codes is Strictly Prohibited, 
Public Notice, 28 FCC Rcd 15438, 15440 (EB 2013) (2013 EAS Enforcement Advisory).  By contrast, general 
alarms or other loud noises, including bells and police or fire sirens, are not considered “simulations” of the EAS 
tones and are not prohibited under section 11.45 of the Commission’s rules.  Id.  
4 Permitted uses of the EAS are limited to alerts of actual emergencies, authorized tests of the EAS, or qualified 
PSAs (collectively, Permitted Uses).  See 47 CFR § 11.45(a).
5 See, e.g., CBS NAL, 34 FCC Rcd at 8418, para. 2; Amendment of Part 11 of the Commission’s Rules Regarding the 
Emergency Alert System, Wireless Emergency Alerts, PS Docket Nos. 15-94, 15-91, Report and Order and Further 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 33 FCC Rcd 7086, 7091, para. 9 (2018) (2018 EAS/WEA Report and Order); 2013 
EAS Enforcement Advisory, 28 FCC Rcd at 15438.
6 See 47 CFR § 11.31(a).  The EAS uses a four-part message for an emergency activation, consisting of:  Preamble 
and EAS Header Codes; audio Attention Signal; message; and Preamble and EAS End of Message (EOM) Codes.  
Id.  The sounds of an EAS message serve the dual purposes of capturing a listener’s or viewer’s attention and 
conveying specially coded information for equipment that is activated by the EAS message as part of an actual 
emergency or authorized test.  See Viacom, Inc., NBC Universal Media, LLC, ESPN Inc., Notice of Apparent 
Liability for Forfeiture, 29 FCC Rcd 2548, 2548, para. 1. (Viacom NAL), aff’d, Viacom, Inc., ESPN, Inc., Forfeiture 
Order, 30 FCC Rcd 797 (2015) (forfeiture paid) (Viacom FO).  The EAS codes consist of audible sounds in which 
encoded information regarding the specific alert is embedded.  See Viacom NAL, 29 FCC Rcd at 2548, para 1.  The 
separate EAS Attention Signal that follows the EAS codes includes two tones that are transmitted simultaneously.

apparent violation of section 11.45(a) of the Commission’s rules, we propose a forfeiture of $504,000 
against FOX.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Legal Framework
5. Pursuant to section 503(b)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), any 
person who is determined by the Commission to have willfully or repeatedly failed to comply with any 
provision of the Act or any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission shall be liable to the 
United States for a forfeiture penalty.10  Section 312(f)(1) of the Act defines willful as “the conscious and 
deliberate commission or omission of such act, irrespective of any intent to violate” the law.11  The 
legislative history to section 312(f)(1) of the Act clarifies that this definition of willful applies to both 
sections 312 and 503(b) of the Act,12 and the Commission has so interpreted the term in the section 503(b) 
context.13  In order to impose such a penalty, the Commission must issue a notice of apparent liability, the 
notice must be received, and the person against whom the notice has been issued must have an 
opportunity to show, in writing, why no such penalty should be imposed.14  The Commission will then 
issue a forfeiture if it finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the person has willfully or repeatedly 
violated the Act or a Commission rule.15
6. Under section 11.45(a) of the Commission’s rules, “[n]o person may transmit or cause to 
transmit the EAS codes or Attention Signal, or a recording or simulation thereof, in any circumstance 
other than in an actual National, State or Local Area emergency or authorized test of the EAS; or as

B. Factual Background
7. Fox Corporation is the ultimate parent of Fox Television Stations, LLC; Fox Television 
Holdings, LLC; Fox Broadcasting Company, LLC; NW Communications of Texas, Inc.; NW 
Communications of Phoenix, Inc.; NW Communications of Austin, Inc.; New World Communications of 
Atlanta, Inc.; New World Communications of Tampa, Inc.; and New World Communications of Detroit, 
Inc.  FOX, a publicly traded Delaware corporation, is a news, sports, and entertainment company.19  FOX 
owns and operates a television broadcast network that produces and distributes programming on its 29 
full power broadcast television stations, and to its more than 200 domestic affiliate stations.20  FOX 
programming is available in “essentially all U.S. households,” and its owned-and-operated television 
stations include 14 of the 15 largest television markets in the United States.21  FOX maintains that it is a 
“leader in marquee live sports broadcasts,” and that FOX Sports programming, including the NFL is “#1 
in live sports viewership among all television networks.”22
8. The Commission received information from multiple sources alleging that at 
approximately 12:20 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 28, 2021, FOX apparently transmitted, or 
caused the transmission of, EAS Tones during a FOX NFL promotional segment (Promotional Segment), 
in the absence of any actual emergency, authorized test of the EAS, or qualified PSA.23  The Enforcement 
Bureau’s Investigations and Hearings Division issued a letter of inquiry (LOI) on January 4, 2022,

[of EAS procedures] at regular intervals . . . .”  Id. § 11.61(a).

Docket Nos. 91–301 and 91–171, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 10 FCC Rcd 1786, 
1815, para. 84 (1994).  In enforcing Section 11.45 of the Commission’s rules, the Commission explained:
The plain language of the rule prohibits any transmission of the EAS Tones in the absence of an actual 
emergency or authorized test . . . . Moreover, [s]ection 11.45 contains no provision limiting liability under 
the rule to cases where intent to deceive exists, nor does the rule make exceptions for, or protect, 
“dramatic” uses of the EAS Tones.  Instead, the rule provides that the transmission of the EAS Tones is 
prohibited in “any circumstance” except when an actual emergency or authorized test warrants their use.

directing FOX to submit, among other things, recordings of the Promotional Segment and sworn written 
statements as to whether it had transmitted, or caused the transmission of, the EAS Tones.24
9. In its LOI Response, FOX describes the Promotional Segment as a short comedic 
advertisement for an upcoming game, aired as part of the FOX NFL SUNDAY pre-game show.25  FOX 
admits that the Promotional Segment used an approximately three-second excerpt of the EAS Attention 
Signal commonly used to precede broadcast emergency alerts: two simultaneous tones of 853 Hz and 960 
Hz.26  The three-second excerpt of the EAS Attention Signal was downloaded or recorded from a 
YouTube video.27  FOX further admits that its transmission of the Promotional Segment, and the EAS 
Tones, was not made in connection with any Permitted Use, i.e., an actual emergency, authorized test of 
the EAS, or qualified PSA.28  FOX acknowledges that it broadcast the Promotional Segment over 18 of its 
owned-and-operated stations, and transmitted it to 190 network affiliated stations nationwide.29  In 
addition to television distribution, FOX caused the transmission of the Promotional Segment on Fox 
Sports Radio, the “leading voice in sports talk entertainment,” broadcasting to radio stations nationwide 
and reaching nearly 15 million listeners on iHeartRadio and FOXSportsRadio.com,30 and on the “Fox 
Sports on XM” channel, which is carried nationwide on the Sirius XM satellite digital audio radio 
service.31  FOX asserts that the Promotional Segment was provided and distributed by the Fox 
Broadcasting Company, LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Fox Corporation.32  Certain 
members of FOX’s production team reviewed the Promotional Segment following its development, and 
prior to its public transmission, but provided no comments or changes.33

Bureau, to Joseph M. Di Scipio and Ann W. Bobeck, FCC Legal and Business Affairs, FOX Corporation (Jan. 4,

transmit the Promotional Segment.  See Letter from Matthew S. DelNero and Brooke Kahn, counsel to FOX, to 
Anya Baez, FCC (Feb. 18, 2022) (on file in EB-IHD-21-00033079) (Supplemental LOI Response).
30 FOX transmitted the Promotional Segment on its FOX NFL SUNDAY programming, and licensed its distribution 
on Fox Sports Radio.  See LOI Response at 2-3 (“While FOX does not maintain a list of all radio stations affiliated 
with Fox Sports Radio, it is FOX’s understanding that such stations typically broadcast FOX NFL SUNDAY”).  
Therefore, FOX knowingly caused the transmission on iHeartRadio and FOXSportsRadio.com.  See, e.g., Viacom 
NAL, 29 FCC Rcd at 2558, para. 23 (section 11.45 clearly applies to actions that cause to transmit the restricted 
tones and is not limited to direct transmissions); CBS NAL, 34 FCC Rcd at 8423, para. 13 (“prohibition thus applies 
to programmers that distribute programming containing a prohibited sound regardless of whether or not they deliver 
the unlawful signal directly to consumers”).  Fox Sports Radio is owned and operated by Premiere Networks, a 
subsidiary of iHeartMedia, Inc.  See LOI Response at 2-3; FOX Sports Radio, 
https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/featured/fox-sports-radio/; https://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/howtolisten/ (last

31 FOX caused the transmission of the Promotional Segment by programing the Fox Sports on XM channel on the 
Sirius XM Audio Entertainment Service, which is owned and operated by Sirius XM Radio Inc.  See LOI Response 
at 2-3.  The Promotional Segment was also posted to Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts controlled by FOX.

III. DISCUSSION
10. We find that FOX apparently willfully violated section 11.45(a) of the Commission’s 
rules.  FOX confirms that the November 28, 2021 broadcast of the Promotional Segment included the 
EAS Tones.34  FOX admits that its wholly owned subsidiary created and distributed the Promotional 
Segment with the EAS Tones, and that it was broadcast by 18 of FOX’s owned-and-operated television 
broadcast stations and 190 network-affiliated television broadcast stations nationwide.35  FOX further 
admits the Promotional Segment that included the EAS Tones was transmitted nationwide over Fox 
Sports Radio and Fox Sports on XM.36  FOX also admits that none of the material in question was 
transmitted in connection with an actual national, state, or local emergency, authorized test, or qualified 
PSA.37
11. Based on FOX’s admissions and our review of the video recording of the Promotional 
Segment, we find that FOX apparently violated section 11.45(a) of the Commission’s rules in its capacity 
as a broadcast programming network and, separately, as a multi-station broadcast licensee.38  Therefore, 
we find FOX responsible for broadcasting the Promotional Segment containing the EAS Tones on 18 of 
its owned-and-operated broadcast stations, transmitting the Promotional Segment to 190 of its network-
affiliated television broadcast stations, and causing the transmission of the Promotional Segment on Fox 
Sports Radio and the Fox Sports on XM channel.
12. Despite being shorter in duration than the full EAS Tones,39 the three-second EAS Tone 
used in the Promotional Segment possessed the same dual-tone frequency, pitch, and timbre as the actual 
EAS Tones, and was recognizable by viewers or listeners as substantially similar to the EAS Tones.40  
The Promotional Segment’s “comedic tone”41 also did not alter or neutralize its overall effect of falsely 
warning listeners and viewers of a non-existent emergency, as the EAS Tones were clearly audible, 
cognizable, and appropriated for a non-emergency use.42  This manner of appropriation of the EAS Tones 
is exactly the type of simulation that the Commission’s rules seek to address and prohibit in order to 
avoid diluting the EAS Tones’ real meaning over time.43
IV. PROPOSED FORFEITURE
13. Section 503(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to impose a forfeiture against any 
entity that “willfully or repeatedly fail[s] to comply with . . . any rule, regulation, or order issued by the 
Commission . . . .”44  Section 503(b)(2)(A) of the Act and section 1.80(b)(1) of the rules authorize us to 
assess a forfeiture against FOX as the licensee of broadcast stations of up to $59,316 per violation or for 
each day of a continuing violation, except that the amount assessed for any continuing violation shall not

exceed a total of $593,170 for a single act or failure to act.45  In exercising our forfeiture authority, we 
must consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation and, with respect to the 
violator, the degree of culpability, any history of prior offenses, ability to pay, and such other matters as 
justice may require.46  The Commission has established forfeiture guidelines, base penalties for certain 
violations, and has identified criteria that it considers when determining the appropriate penalty in any 
given case.47  Under these guidelines, we may adjust a forfeiture downward for violations that are minor, 
violations that are voluntarily disclosed, where there is a history of compliance, or where there is an 
inability to pay.48  We may adjust a forfeiture upward for violations that are egregious, intentional, 
repeated, that cause substantial harm or generate substantial economic gain for the violator, where there is 
an ability to pay, or where there is a history of prior violations of FCC requirements.49  
14. Section 1.80(b) of the Commission’s rules provides for a base forfeiture of $8,000 for 
various EAS and false distress rule violations, for each violation or each day of a continuing violation.50  
The Commission has previously applied an $8,000 base forfeiture for violations of section 11.45(a) of the 
Commission’s rules.51  We have discretion, however, to depart from the base forfeiture guidelines, taking 
into account the particular facts of each individual case.52  In determining the proposed forfeiture amount, 
we considered the factors outlined in the Commission’s Forfeiture Policy Statement, section 1.80 of the 
Commission’s rules, and section 503 of the Act.  We have considered the number of transmissions at 
issue, FOX’s sizeable nationwide audience reach, the gravity of the violation, the violator’s degree of 
culpability, ability to pay, and the serious public safety implications of the apparent violations, as well as 
the other factors outlined in the Commission’s Forfeiture Policy Statement and section 1.80 of the 
Commission’s rules. 
15. The nature of EAS violations requires particularly serious consideration because, among 
other issues, such violations undermine the integrity of the EAS by desensitizing the public to the 
potential importance of warning tones.  EAS violations therefore implicate substantial public safety 
concerns.  As explained in the CBS NAL, our forfeiture determination in such cases is based on multiple 
factors associated with the nature of the violation and the violator.53  When applying the statutory factors 
concerning the circumstances, extent, and gravity of an EAS violation, we take into account a number of 
specific factors, including:  (1) the number of repetitions (i.e., the number of individual transmissions); 
(2) the duration of the violation (i.e., the number of days or months over which the violation occurred); 
(3) the audience reach of the transmissions (e.g., nationwide, regional, or local); and (4) the extent of the 
45 47 U.S.C. § 503(b)(2)(A); 47 CFR § 1.80(b)(1).  See Amendment of Section 1.80(b) of the Commission’s Rules, 
Annual Adjustment of Civil Monetary Penalties to Reflect Inflation, DA-22-1356, 88 Fed. Reg. 783 (Jan. 5, 2023)

public safety impact (e.g., whether an EAS activation is triggered).54  While each of these factors may be 
significant in a given case, no single factor (e.g., the number of transmissions) is controlling. 
16. In this case, we find FOX responsible for broadcasting the EAS Tones during the 
Promotional Segment over 18 television broadcast stations that it owns and operates.  In its capacity as a 
broadcast licensee, FOX transmitted the EAS Tones one time over each of its 18 television broadcast 
stations, resulting in a base forfeiture of $144,000.
17. Reviewing the factors in this case, we find that an upward adjustment is warranted.  FOX 
stated that its programming is available in “essentially all U.S. households,” and its television broadcast 
stations are located in the five largest, and fifteen of the top twenty, television markets in the United 
States.55  As such, the audience reach of each of the FOX owned-and-operated stations is considerable and 
warrants an upward adjustment of the base forfeiture levied against FOX’s 18 television broadcast 
stations.  Moreover, in this particular case, the creation and transmission of the Promotional Segment 
involved a self-promotion by FOX for its upcoming pre-game programming and NFL game.56  As a 
leader in live sports broadcasts,57 and a longstanding broadcast licensee, FOX was well aware of the 
importance and implementation of the EAS rules.58  We find that, in view of the gravity of the violation 
and the violator’s degree of culpability, this self-promotion for the purposes of additional economic gain59 
at the expense of the integrity of the EAS constitutes egregious misconduct warranting an additional 
upward adjustment.
18. We also find FOX responsible for transmitting the Promotional Segment containing the 
EAS Tones to its television station affiliates nationwide for broadcast, as well as Fox Sports Radio and 
Fox Sports on XM.  These were separate actions that resulted in separate transmissions of the simulated 
EAS Tones.60  The Commission is not pursuing a forfeiture in this case for FOX’s transmissions and 
responsibilities in its capacity as a programming network due to the expiration of the statute of limitations 
period.  However, we emphasize that these actions constitute violations of the Commission’s rules, and 
we find that they warrant an additional upward adjustment.61    
19. Given the totality of the circumstances, and consistent with the Forfeiture Policy 
Statement, section 1.80 of the Commission’s rules, and the statutory factors, we conclude that a proposed 
forfeiture of $504,000 is appropriate in this case for FOX’s apparent egregious violation of section 
11.45(a) of the Commission’s rules.

Commission can consider facts that occurred outside the statute of limitations period in assessing an appropriate 
forfeiture amount).
784Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-4
20. Based on our review of the current record, we find no basis for a downward adjustment.62  
First, this was not a minor violation.  FOX had clear and unambiguous notice of the requirements and 
applicability of the EAS rules to its advertising programming,63 as evidenced in its advertising guidelines, 
which clearly prohibited the use of EAS Tones, or simulation thereof, in advertisements “under any 
circumstances.”64  Yet, despite touting that it is fully knowledgeable and has a policy “barring the 
improper use of the EAS Attention Signals,” which was purportedly “made known generally to 
employees of FOX involved in the production of programming,” FOX admits that “all personnel involved 
in creation and review of the Nov. 28 Segment … lacked full understanding of FOX’s policy against use 
of EAS Attention Signals.”65  Second, this case involved a mandatory, not voluntary, disclosure.  
Commission rule 11.45(b) requires EAS participants to notify the Commission within 24 hours of 
discovering it has transmitted a false alert to the public.66  FOX’s having sent an e-mail to the FCC Ops 
Center67 as required by the Commission’s rules, does not constitute the type of good faith disclosure that 
warrants a reduction to the proposed forfeiture amount.68  Third, as FOX acknowledges, it has been the 
subject of previous enforcement actions.69  We therefore find no countervailing downward adjustment to 
be appropriate based on compliance history.70  Finally, we note that FOX reported substantial revenue of 
$4.44 billion for the relevant quarter.71  FOX clearly has an ability to pay, and there is nothing in the 
record that would indicate that the penalty is otherwise excessive.72  Therefore, we find FOX apparently 
liable for a total forfeiture of $504,000.73 
62 47 CFR § 1.80(b)(10), Table 3 (downward adjustment factors include minor violations, good faith or voluntary 
disclosure, history of overall compliance, and inability to pay).

to reduce the forfeiture when licensee’s history of overall compliance includes past violations).
71 See FOX Corporation Revenues, supra note 59.
72 While ability to pay and a history of prior violations of any FCC requirements could be used as a basis for an 
upward adjustment, 47 CFR § 1.80(b)(10), Table 3, we find doing so here unnecessary in light of the upward 
adjustment factors discussed above.  See supra paras. 17-18.

V. CONCLUSION
21. In view of the foregoing, we determine that FOX apparently willfully violated section 
11.45(a) of the Commission’s rules and propose a total forfeiture of $504,000.
VI. ORDERING CLAUSES
22. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to section 503(b) of the Act74 and section

APPENDIX
I.         BACKGROUND
1. The Commission has before it for comparative consideration 34 groups of mutually 
exclusive (MX) applications for new noncommercial educational (NCE) FM station construction 
permits.1  By this Memorandum Opinion and Order (Order), we perform threshold fair distribution of 
service analyses and use a point system to tentatively select an application for grant in each group.  
Petitions to deny the application of any of these tentative selectees must be filed within 30 days of the 
1 On November 29, 2021, the Media Bureau (Bureau) issued a public notice identifying 231 groups of mutually 
exclusive NCE FM applications.  See Media Bureau Identifies Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications Submitted 
in the November 2021, Filing Window for New Noncommercial Educational Stations, MB Docket No. 20-343, 
Public Notice, DA 21-1476 (MB rel. Nov. 29, 2021) (NCE MX Public Notice).  Each of the groups analyzed herein 
was included in the NCE MX Public Notice.

date of release of this Order.2 
2. We address in this Order applications that were filed in November 2021, during the most 
recent filing window for new NCE FM applications.3  These applicants have had an opportunity to enter 
into settlement agreements among themselves to resolve mutual exclusivity,4 and, in the absence of any 
such settlement, are now subject to a simplified, comparative process codified in Part 73, Subpart K, of 
our rules.5  
II. GENERAL NCE COMPARATIVE PROCEDURES
3. Given the finite nature of and high demand for spectrum, the Commission cannot grant a 
construction permit to every qualified NCE applicant.  Due to the noncommercial nature of the NCE 
service, MX6 applications for new station construction permits are not subject to auction, but are resolved 
by applying comparative procedures.7  Specifically, the Commission’s comparative analysis of MX NCE 
applications generally consists of three main components.  First, when NCE FM applicants in an MX 
group propose service to different communities, the Commission performs a threshold fair distribution 
analysis under section 307(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act).8  Second, 
application conflicts that are not resolved under this “fair distribution” analysis are compared by the 
Commission under an NCE point system,9 which is a simplified, “paper hearing” process.10  Third, if 
2 See 47 CFR § 73.7004(b).
3 See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Application Filing Window; Window Open from November 2, 
2021, to November 9, 2021, MB Docket No. 20-343, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 7449 (MB rel. April 21, 2021).  
The window was available for FM reserved band (channels 201-220) proposals.  See 47 CFR § 73.501.   
4 See NCE MX Public Notice at 2-5.  The NCE FM applicants had an opportunity to enter into and file settlement 
agreements and to submit technical amendments to resolve conflicts and expedite the grant of applications filed in 
the NCE FM window.  
5 47 CFR §§ 73.7000 – 7005.  See also Comparative Consideration of 27 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications 
for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 22-
61 (2022) (27 Group Comparative Order) (applying the comparative procedures to identify and tentatively select 27 
NCE FM applications from the November 2021, window for grant). 
6 Conflicting NCE applications, which cannot all be granted consistent with the Commission's technical rules, are 
considered mutually exclusive.  An MX group consists of all applications which are MX to at least one other 
application in the group.

307(b) analyses, we are performing the Section 307(b) analyses, where applicable herein, for certain groups in 
conjunction with our point system analyses in order to expedite consideration of these groups.  See Comparative 
Consideration of 76 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New or Modified 
Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, 22 FCC Rcd 6101, n.16 (2007) (NCE

necessary, the Commission makes a tie-breaker determination, based on applicant-provided data and 
certifications.  Each of these steps is described in greater detail below.11 
A. 307(b) --Threshold Fair Distribution Study.
4. Section 307(b) states that the Commission must “provide a fair, efficient, and equitable 
distribution” of broadcast service among the states and communities.12  In accordance with this directive, 
the Commission considers the fair distribution of service as a first, or threshold, issue in its NCE FM 
comparative review process13 in order to ascertain whether grant of any of the applications would best 
further the Section 307(b) objective.14  The first step of the Section 307(b), or fair distribution, analysis, is 
to determine whether any of the applicants in the MX group is a federally recognized Native American 
Tribe or Alaska Native Village proposing to serve Tribal Lands15 and claims the Tribal Priority.16  
5. If there is no Tribal Applicant in the MX group,17 the second step in the Section 307(b) 
analysis is to determine whether any applicant would provide a first or second reserved band channel 
NCE aural service to a substantial population (the First or Second NCE Service Preference) by comparing 
population coverage totals.18  Specifically, during this step, an NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a 
11 In advance of the November 2021 filing window, the Commission amended its rules and procedures for filing 
NCE FM applications and selecting and licensing competing NCE FM applications.  See NCE LPFM Order, supra 
note 7.  The changes were designed to improve the comparative selection procedures, reduce confusion among 
future applicants, expedite the initiation of new service to the public, and eliminate unnecessary applicant burdens.  
See also Media Bureau Announces October 30, 2020, Effective Date of New NCE and LPFM Rules, Public Notice, 
MB Docket No. 19-3, DA 20-1298 (Nov. 2, 2020).
12 47 U.S.C. § 307(b). 
13 See 47 CFR § 73.7002; 2000 NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7396 (2000) (concluding that “fair distribution of 
stations to communities should remain a threshold issue”); 2001 NCE MO&O, 16 FCC Rcd at 5077 (“when 
competing FM applications propose to serve different communities, a proposal would be considered best, as a 
threshold matter, if it would provide service to a significant unserved or underserved population”).  
14 See 47 U.S.C. § 307(b) (“In considering applications for licenses . . . when and insofar as there is demand for the 
same, the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses, frequencies, hours of operation, and of power among 
the several States and communities as to provide a fair, efficient, and equitable distribution of radio service to each 
of the same.”); 47 CFR § 73.7002(a).  Applicants’ Form 2100, Schedule 340, Fair Distribution of Service 
certifications enable the Commission to consider whether service to one community over the other would best 
achieve the Commission’s directive to distribute radio service fairly among communities. 
15 See 47 CFR §§ 73.7000, 73.7002(b).
16 An NCE FM applicant is eligible to receive a fair distribution preference, and ultimately be awarded the 
construction permit, if it identifies itself as a Tribal Applicant, proposes Tribal Coverage, and proposes the first 
reserved channel NCE service owned by any Tribal Applicant at a community of license located on Tribal Lands 
(the Tribal Priority).  See 47 CFR § 73.7000 (defining a “Tribal Applicant” and “Tribal Coverage”); see also 47 
CFR § 73.7002(b); Policies to Promote Rural Radio Service and to Streamline Allotment and Assignment 
Procedures, First Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 1583 (2010) (establishing the Section 307(b) Tribal Priority).

Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations Filed in November 2021 Window, FCC 22-28, 
Memorandum Opinion and Order (rel. April 19, 2022). 
17 None of the MX groups addressed in this Order contain a Tribal Applicant.  Accordingly, the first step of the 
Section 307(b) analysis, the Tribal Priority analysis, is inapplicable herein.
18 See 47 CFR § 73.7002(b).  
791Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
fair distribution preference (or Section 307(b) preference)19 if it would provide a first or second reserved 
band channel NCE aural service to at least 10% of the population (in the aggregate), within the proposed 
station’s service area, provided that the population served is at least 2,000 people.  If only one applicant in 
an MX group qualifies for the First or Second NCE Service Preference, its “fair distribution” (Section 
307(b)) preference is dispositive,20 and that applicant will be awarded the construction permit.  
6. If more than one applicant in the MX group claims a First or Second NCE Service 
Preference, the applicant proposing to provide the greatest number of people with the highest level of 
service will be awarded a construction permit, if it will provide such service to at least 10% of the people 
within the station's 60 dBu contour and to at least 5,000 more people than the next best applicant.21  First 
service will be preferred over second service.22  Accordingly, the Commission first examines the 
applicants' first service levels alone to determine whether one of the proposals is superior and should 
receive a decisive preference.  If such applicants are equivalent with respect to first service, or no 
applicant qualifies for a first service preference, the Commission considers combined first and second 
NCE aural service population totals.  At each stage of the Section 307(b) analysis, any applicant that is 
comparatively disfavored in terms of Section 307(b) eligibility or service totals is eliminated.  The 
process ends when the Commission determines that one applicant is entitled to a Section 307(b) 
preference, or that either (1) none of the remaining applicants can be selected or eliminated based on a 
Section 307(b) preference, or (2) each remaining applicant proposes to serve the same community.  Any 
remaining MX applicants proposing equivalent service overall, or proposing the same community, 
proceed to a point system analysis.23  
7. Each applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service preference must support its fair 
distribution claim with an exhibit identifying the population residing within the proposed station’s 60 dBµ 
service contour and the number of people that would receive a new first or second NCE aural service.24  
Further, any applicant which receives a decisive Section 307(b) preference is required to construct and 
operate technical facilities substantially as proposed, and cannot downgrade service to the area on which 
the preference was based for a period of four years of on-air operations.25
19 The terms “fair distribution preference” and “Section 307(b) preference” are used interchangeably to refer to the 
preference given to an MX application that is deemed to substantially further the fair distribution of service goals 
enunciated in Section 307(b).
20 As noted, in the case of an MX group with a Tribal Applicant, an applicant qualifying for a Tribal Priority, 
however, will prevail over any MX applicant claiming a First or Second NCE Service Preference.
21 47 CFR § 73.7002(b).
22 Id.
23 See 47 CFR § 73.7003 (point system selection procedures).
24 See id. § 73.7002(b).  Applicants were required to use the most recently available, i.e., 2010 Census, population 
data.  See Media Bureau Announces NCE FM New Station Filing Procedures and Requirements for November 2-9, 
2021, Window, DA 21-885, at 5-7 and n.24 (MB rel. July 23, 2021) (NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice); FCC 
Form 2100, Schedule 340, Instructions for Fair Distribution of Service at 12-14.  An applicant’s fair distribution 
showing must be computed as of the time of filing (close of the filing window for applications filed prior to the 
window) and cannot be enhanced thereafter.  See 47 CFR § 73.7003(e) and (f)(3); NCE Filing Procedures Public 
Notice at 11; 2001 NCE MO&O, 16 FCC Rcd at 5082-83.  However, an applicant that subsequently makes 
engineering changes that would diminish its fair distribution position must amend its application to reflect that 
diminished position.  See 47 CFR §§ 1.65 and 73.7003(e).  
25 See 47 CFR § 73.7005(b); see also 47 CFR § 73.7002(c).  During this period, such applicant may make minor 
modifications to its authorized facilities, provided that “(i) the modification does not downgrade service to the area 
on which the preference was based, or (ii) any potential loss of first and second NCE service is offset by at least 
equal first and, separately, combined first and second NCE service population gain(s), and the applicant would 
continue to qualify for a decisive Section 307(b) preference.”).  Id.

B. Point System Selection Process.
8. The Commission compares mutually exclusive groups of NCE FM applications, which 
cannot be decided pursuant to the Section 307(b) analysis, under the point system set forth in section 
73.7003 of the rules.26  The NCE point system awards a maximum of seven merit points, based on four 
distinct criteria, described below.27  When MX NCE FM applications proceed to a point system analysis, 
the Commission reviews the applicants’ point submissions28 to compare the MX applications and 
tentatively select the application with the highest point total from each MX group for grant.29    
9. First, we award three points to applicants certifying that they have been local and 
established for at least two years.  To qualify for the three points as an “established local applicant”30 an 
applicant must certify that it has been local and established in the community to be served continuously 
for at least two years immediately prior to the application filing.31  To be considered local, a non-
governmental applicant must have a physical headquarters, campus, or 75% of its governing board 
members residing within 25 miles of the reference coordinates of the proposed community of license.32  A 
governmental unit is considered local within its jurisdictional boundaries.33
10. If an applicant certifies that it is an “established local applicant” it must submit 
substantiating documentation with its application to illustrate how it qualifies as local and established.34  
Examples of acceptable documentation include corporate material from the secretary of state, lists of 
names, addresses, and length of residence of board members and copies of governing documents 
requiring a 75% local governing board, or course brochures indicating that classes have been offered at a 
local campus for the preceding two years.35  Any applicant awarded localism points in this Order has 
provided support for its certification.  Thus, the specific point system determinations for each MX group 
26 See 47 CFR § 73.7003.  Unlike the 307(b) analysis, the point system selection process cannot be performed by the 
Bureau on delegated authority.  See 2000 NCE Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7420. 
27 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(b).
28 Each NCE FM applicant was required to complete the “Point System Factors/Tie Breakers” Section of FCC Form 
2100, Schedule 340, Noncommercial Educational Station for Reserved Channel Construction Permit Application 
(Schedule 340) in the Bureau’s Licensing and Management System (LMS) by the November 9, 2021 filing deadline.
29 The Commission has reaffirmed its longstanding one-grant policy.  See NCE Order on Reconsideration, supra 
note 7.  The one-grant policy provides that only one application should be granted out of each mutually exclusive 
group, while providing the remaining competing applicants the opportunity to file again in the next filing window.  
Id.  The Commission will not authorize “secondary grants” in MX NCE FM groups after the initial resolution of the 
MX applications.  A secondary grant process would allow non-winning applicants that are not mutually exclusive 
with the tentative selectee to proceed to a second round of analysis by the Commission.  Id.  See also NCE LPFM 
Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12528, n.68 (reaffirming the established one-grant policy and declining to pursue a secondary 
application grant practice).  
30 See 47 CFR § 73.7000.  
31 See id. § 73.7003(b)(1).
32 A local headquarters or residence must be a primary place of business or residence and not, for example, a post 
office box, lawyer's office, branch office, or vacation home, which are more easily feigned and/or present less of an 
opportunity for meaningful contact with the community.  See 2000 Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7410, para. 54.
33 For example, a state government is considered local throughout the state; a City Board of Education is considered 
local through the city; a state university is considered local throughout the state. 
34 An applicant claiming points as an established local applicant must also pledge to maintain localism 
characteristics during the period from grant of the construction permit until the station has achieved at least four 
years of on-air operations.  See 47 CFR § 73.7005(c); see also NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12523, para 8.
35 See NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 8.
793Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
that follows only discuss an applicant’s documentation if it is insufficient to justify awarding localism 
points.
11. Second, we award two points for local diversity of ownership if no party to the 
application holds an attributable interest in any other station within the principal community contours of 
the applicant’s proposed station.36  To qualify for the diversity of ownership points, an applicant must 
submit either a contour map showing no overlap with the proposed NCE FM station, a statement that the 
applicant holds no attributable interests in any nearby radio stations, or a certification that it holds no 
attributable interests in any broadcast stations.37  Any applicant awarded diversity of ownership points in 
this Order has either satisfied this requirement or submitted a divestiture pledge, as detailed below.  Thus, 
the specific point system determinations for each MX group that follows only discuss an applicant’s 
documentation if it is insufficient to justify awarding diversity points.  
12. We note that an NCE FM applicant with an overlapping attributable interest, however, 
can still qualify for diversity of ownership points if it commits to divest the broadcast interest or resign 
from the attributable positional interest.38  The applicant must submit the divestiture pledge with the 
application by the close of the filing window.  We do not require the applicant to divest or resign by the 
close of the filing window.  Rather, if we award that applicant a construction permit based on points, the 
applicant must complete the actual divestiture or resignation by the time the new NCE FM station 
commences program test operations.39
13. Third, we award two points for certain state-wide networks providing programming to 
accredited schools.  These points are available only to applicants that cannot claim a credit for local 
diversity of ownership.40  The state-wide network credit is an alternative for applicants that use multiple 
stations to serve large numbers of schools and, therefore, do not qualify for the local diversity of 
ownership credit.  Applicants claiming points as a state-wide network must submit supporting 
documentation as an application exhibit.41    
14. Fourth, an applicant that proposes the best technical proposal in the group (i.e., proposes 
service to the largest population and area, excluding substantial areas of water) may receive up to two 
points.  The applicant receives one point if its proposed service area and population are 10% greater than 
those of the next best area and population proposals, or two points if both are 25% greater than those of 
the next best area and population proposals as measured by each proposed station’s predicted 60 dBu 
signal strength contour.42  If the best technical proposal does not meet the 10% threshold, no applicant is 
36 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(b)(2).  Parties with attributable interests are defined as the applicant, its parent, 
subsidiaries, their officers, and members of their governing boards.  See 47 CFR § 73.7000.  Interests of certain 
entities providing more than 33% of the applicant’s equity and/or debt are also attributable.  Id.
37 See Attributable Interests, Other Authorizations, of Schedule 340.  An applicant claiming points for diversity of 
ownership must also pledge to comply with the restrictions on station modifications and acquisitions during the 
period from grant of the construction permit until the station has achieved at least four years of on-air operations.  
See 47 CFR § 73.7005(c); see also NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12524, para. 12. 
38 See NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12525, para. 13 (expanding the Commission’s divestiture policy by 
recognizing full-service station divestiture pledges for comparative purposes and crediting all contingent divestiture 
pledges that are made and submitted by the close of the filing window).

awarded points under this criterion.  In considering this criterion, we have accepted applicants’ coverage 
and population claims.43
15. Finally, the Commission tallies the total number of points awarded to each applicant.  
The applicant with the highest score in a group is designated the “tentative selectee.”  All other applicants 
are eliminated.
C. Tie-Breakers. 
16. In the event MX applicants are tied with the highest number of points, the tied applicants  
proceed to a tie-breaker round.44  The first tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.45  The applicant with the fewest attributable 
authorizations prevails and becomes the tentative selectee.  If the tie is not broken by this first factor, we 
apply a second tie-breaker:  the number of pending radio station applications attributable to each 
applicant.46  The tentative selectee will be the applicant with the fewest pending new and major change 
applications in the same service.  
17. If a tie remains after the second tie-breaker, applicants are considered under a third and 
final tie-breaker criterion – prior NCE applications.47  The tentative selectee will be the applicant that can 
demonstrate that: (1) it applied in a previous filing window, and had its application accepted for filing and 
processed, but subsequently dismissed in favor of an applicant possessing superior points or a tie-breaker 
showing; (2) it was in continuous existence as a legal entity at all times from the date of the previous NCE 
window filing until the present; and (3) it does not hold any NCE construction permit or license.48  If this 
third factor fails to break the tie, we use time-sharing as the tie-breaker of last resort.  Specifically, we 
designate the remaining tied applicants in the MX group as the tentative selectees and direct the tentative 
selectees to submit, within 90 days of the release of the Order identifying the tentative selectees, a 
voluntary time-sharing agreement.49   
both factors.  The Commission will compare the top applicant’s proposed area to the proposed area of the applicant 
with the next best area proposal and the top applicant’s population to the proposed population of the applicant with 
the next best population proposal.
43 Our procedures for this filing window required applicants to measure area in square kilometers and exclude 
significant areas of water, e.g., oceans and lakes, and measure population using the 2010 Census Block Data 
available from the Census Bureau.  See Form 2100, Schedule 340 Instructions at page 16.
44 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(c).
45 Id. § 73.7003(c)(1).  Applicants are required to count all attributable full service commercial and NCE radio 
stations (licenses and construction permits) and any FM translator stations providing non-fill-in service.  An 
applicant may exclude fill-in translators, any translator which the applicant seeks to replace with its applied for full-
service NCE FM station, and any station, which it pledges to divest.  See 2001 NCE MO&O, 16 FCC Rcd at 5102-
03, para. 85; see also Form 2100, Schedule 340 Instructions at page 17.  
46 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(c)(2).  When reporting pending applications, applicants were required to include new and 
major change radio applications, including the subject application and all other applications filed in the window by 
the November 9, 2021 deadline.  Applicants should not have included any requests to participate in an auction filed 
on Schedule 175 and other applications such as voluntary assignment of license, license renewal, and minor change 
in existing facilities.  See NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 10.
47 See NCE LPFM Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 12527-28, para. 19; 47 CFR § 73.7003(c)(3).
48 Id.  Applicants were required to submit an attachment demonstrating their qualifications under this third tie-
breaker criterion.
49 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(c)(4).  If the tentative selectees do not agree on a voluntary time sharing arrangement 
within 90 days, we will impose mandatory time sharing, granting all tentative selectees “equal, concurrent, non-
renewable” licenses.  47 CFR § 73.7003(c)(5).
795Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
D. Timely Documentation of Comparative Qualifications.
18. The NCE FM application, Schedule 340, is certification-based, but requires applicants to 
document certain of their claims by submitting supporting information.50  Applicants must submit timely-
filed exhibits supporting their point claims.  We will not give credit to certifications which require the 
applicant to submit documentation, but which are not supported with any such timely submitted 
documentation.  For example, we reject claims in this Order where the applicant certifies that it qualifies 
for points as an established local applicant but fails to supply supporting information referred to in the 
certification.  While there is some flexibility in the type of documentation an applicant may provide, an 
applicant that does not submit timely support cannot have made a valid certification and will not receive 
the claimed points.51  Similarly, we will not consider documentation to support a claimed comparative 
point if it was submitted in an amendment after the November 2021, filing deadline.  In such cases, we 
adjust the points of such applicants downward.
19. Finally, the NCE FM applicant's qualifications for points are initially determined “as of 
the closing of the filing window” i.e., the November 9, 2021, filing deadline.52  For example, NCE 
organizations are considered “established” if they have operated as local entities since November 9, 
2019, i.e., for at least two years prior to the November 9, 2021, Application Deadline.  These “snap shot” 
applicant characteristics establish an applicant's maximum points and its maximum position in the event 
of a tie-breaker.  This common reference date ensures a level competitive field for applicants, with their 
qualifications all compared as of the same time.53  In order to prevent gamesmanship, any changes made 
after the filing deadline may potentially diminish, but cannot enhance, an applicant's comparative position 
and point total.  Therefore, we have taken into account any amendments that adversely affect an 
applicant’s point total and comparative position.  We have not considered any amendments, filed after the 
filing deadline, which improve an applicant’s comparative position.54   
III. GROUP-BY-GROUP ANALYSES 
20. This Section contains narrative descriptions of our analyses, organized sequentially by 
group number.  Unless otherwise noted, each component of the analysis is based on information provided 
by each of the respective applicants.55  We have provided readers with an Appendix that condenses the 
group-by-group narratives that follow into chart form for quick reference.  
50 See 2000 NCE Report and Order, 15 FCC Rcd at 7423, para. 89.
51 See, e.g., Comparative Consideration of 32 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct 
New or Modified Noncommercial Educational FM Stations Filed in the October 2007 Filing Window, Memorandum 
Opinion and Order, 25 FCC Rcd 5013, 5017, para. 11 (2010) (“applicant submitting no timely documentation at all 
cannot be found to have made a valid certification”).
52 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(e).
53 See, e.g., 2001 NCE MO&O, 16 FCC Rcd at 5082-83, paras. 23-26; see also id. at 5083, para. 26 (“Of overall 
concern to us in this area is that we are comparing applications that use the same data.  Reliance on information as of 
the close of the window will ensure that applicants have essentially a common reference date.  With a common 
reference date and a common method of calculating population, the staff will analyze applicants on a similar 
basis.”).
54 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(e).  For example, an applicant may lose claimed points, such as the diversity of ownership 
points, as a result of acquiring an overlapping station after the November 2021, filing deadline.  In contrast, if an 
applicant certifies that it does not qualify for one of the point factors, it cannot later amend its application to claim 
such points.  This is the case even if the applicant actually would have qualified for the point it is seeking at the time 
it filed the application.
55 See FCC Form 2100, Schedule 340, Fair Distribution of Service certifications and Point System 
Factors/Tiebreakers certifications.  
796Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
21. At the outset, we again note that each group of applicants has had an opportunity to 
resolve mutual exclusivities by settlement and technical amendment.  In addition, we emphasize that 
applicants were required to report their qualifications as of the date of closing of the filing window.56  
Any changes made thereafter may potentially have diminished, but could not enhance, an applicant’s 
comparative position.  Finally, we note that the majority of these 34 groups require no discussion of the 
initial 307(b) analysis because the applicants within the group either all proposed to serve the same 
community57 or certified that they are not eligible for a fair distribution preference.  In such cases, we 
proceed directly to the point system analysis.
22.Group 14.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to different 
communities in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.  Gentry Communications Network, Inc. (GCN) 
proposes to serve Sulphur Springs, Arkansas; Centro Familiar de Restauracion y Vida (CFRV) proposes 
to serve Noel, Missouri; and Citizenship Tulsa, Inc. (CT) proposes to serve Adair, Oklahoma.  Each 
applicant claims that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference.58  GCN and CT each claims a fair 
distribution preference based on first NCE service population totals.  CFRV does not, and is therefore, 
eliminated.  GCN and CT claim to provide first NCE service to 7,772 people and 6,198 people, 
respectively.  The proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people.  
Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals.  GCN would provide 
a first or second NCE service to 18,334 people (7,772 first service plus 10,562 second service); CT to 
18,332 people (6,198 first service plus 12,134 second service).  Because these proposals are also 
comparable, GCN and CT proceed to a point system analysis.
23. GCN claims three points as an established local applicant.  CT certifies that it is not 
entitled to any points under this criterion.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership, 
with GCN’s claim based on a commitment to divest LPFM station KOZR-LP, Gentry, Arkansas.  CT did 
not submit documentation to support its diversity claim, and certifies that it has two other existing 
authorizations.  Thus, we do not award diversity of ownership points to CT.59  Neither applicant claims 
points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, GCN’s proposed 60 dBu contour 
would encompass 1,973 square kilometers with a population of 34,210.  CT’s proposed 60 dBu contour 
would encompass 1,674 square kilometers with a population of 29,747.  GCN qualifies for one point as 
the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than CT.  
Accordingly, CT is not credited with any points, and GCN is credited with a total of six points.  GCN is, 
therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 14.
24.Group 16.  This group consists of two applications proposing service to different 
communities in Arizona.  Remanente Broadcasting Network (RBN) proposes to serve Dudleyville, and 
Arizona Board of Regents for Benefit of University of Arizona (ABOR) proposes to serve Kearny.  
Neither applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, the applicants proceed 
to a point system analysis.
56 NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice at 10-11.
57 The fair distribution analysis is only considered when applicants in an MX group propose to serve different 
communities. 
58 See File Nos. 167736, 167086 and 167841, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits. GCN’s 
60 dBu contour encompasses 34,210 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 18,334 
people.  CFRV’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 40,137 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE 
service is 15,524 people.  CT’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 29,747 people, and its claimed aggregated first and 
second NCE service is 18,332 people.  Thus, each applicant would provide a combined first and second NCE service 
to at least 10% of the population within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people.
59 We note that even if we were to award the two diversity points to CT, it would not change the outcome of this 
group.
797Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
25. ABOR claims three points as an established local applicant.  RBN certifies that it is not 
entitled to any points under this criterion.  RBN claims two points for diversity of ownership; ABOR does 
not.  Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, 
RBN’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 4,140 square kilometers with a population of 23,872.  
ABOR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,523 square kilometers with a population of 7,351.  
RBN qualifies for one point as the best technical proposal because it would serve at least 10% more area 
and population than ABOR.  Accordingly, RBN and ABOR are each credited with three points and 
proceed to the tie-breaker analysis.
26. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  RBN certifies that it has no attributable interest in any radio authorization, and ABOR certifies 
that it has attributable interests in 26 radio authorizations.  RBN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in 
Group 16.60
27.Group 32.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to different 
communities in California.  Delta 2000 (Delta) proposes to serve Byron; Iglesia del Valle (IDV) proposes 
to serve Manteca; and Hatch Workshop (HW) proposes to serve Terminous.  No applicant claims 
eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system 
analysis.
28. Each applicant claims three points as an established local applicant.  However, because 
IDV did not submit any supporting documentation for its localism claim, we do not award IDV localism 
points.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership.  IDV, however, certifies that it has 
one other existing authorization and did not submit documentation to support its diversity claim.  We, 
therefore, do not award IDV points under this criterion.  IDV also claims two points as a state-wide 
network.  Such points, however, are only available to applicants that do not qualify for two points for 
diversity of ownership.  IDV cannot claim points under both criteria.61  With respect to technical 
parameters, Delta’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 167 square kilometers with a population 
of 10,376.   HW’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 274 square kilometers with a population of 
37,566.  IDV’s application is incomplete because it only lists the proposed population, and we, therefore, 
cannot consider IDV’s technical parameters in our analysis.  HW qualifies for two points as the best 
technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 25% more area and population than Delta.  
Accordingly, IDV is not credited with any points, Delta is credited with a total of five points, and HW is 
credited with a total of seven points.  HW is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 32.
29.Group 34.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to different 
communities in California.  Remanente Broadcasting Network (RBN) proposes to serve Boron; Cedar 
Broadcasting, Inc. (CBI) proposes to serve Randsburg; and Nevada Public Radio (NPR) proposes to serve 
Ridgecrest.  No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, the applicants 
proceed to a point system analysis.
30. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or as a state-wide network.  
RBN and NPR claim two points each for diversity of ownership.  CBI certifies that it is not entitled to 
points under this criterion.  With respect to technical parameters, RBN’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
encompass 8,002 square kilometers with a population of 42,073.  CBI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
encompass 4,838 square kilometers with a population of 49,003.  NPR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
60 We note that Triangle Access Broadcasting, Inc. (TABI) filed an Informal Objection to the RBN application.  See 
Pleading No. 167141.  We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any 
objection if/when the subject application becomes accepted for filing.  We will review the merits of TABI’s 
objection after the tentative selectee’s application is accepted for filing.
61 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(b)(3).  Moreover, IDV does not submit any information to support its claim that it qualifies 
as a state-wide network.
798Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
encompass 8,571 square kilometers with a population of 53,539.  Because no applicant’s proposal would 
serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal, we do not award points for this 
criterion.  Accordingly, CBI is not credited with any points; RBN and NPR are each credited with a total 
of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
31. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  RBN certifies that it has no attributable interests in any radio authorization, and NPR certifies 
that it has attributable interests in 15 radio authorizations.  RBN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in 
Group 34.62
32.Group 49B.63  This group consists of three applications proposing service to different 
communities in Virginia.  Positive Alternative Radio, Inc. (PAR) proposes to serve Courtland; Redeemer 
Broadcasting, Inc. (RBI) proposes to serve Fredericksburg; and Calvary Baptist Church of Spotsylvania 
(CBCS) proposes to serve Spotsylvania.  No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  
Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
33. CBCS claims three points as an established local applicant.  PAR and RBI do not claim 
points under this criterion.  RBI and CBCS claim two points each for diversity of ownership.  PAR 
certifies that it does not qualify for points under this criterion.  No applicant claims points as a state-wide 
network.  With respect to technical parameters, PAR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,764 
square kilometers with a population of 153,432.  RBI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,164 
square kilometers with a population of 133,089.  CBCS’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 
1,407 square kilometers with a population of 146,515.  No applicant qualifies for points under the best 
technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population 
than the next best proposal.  Accordingly, PAR is not credited with any points; RBI is credited with a 
total of two points; CBCS is credited with a total of five points.  CBCS is, therefore, the tentative selectee 
in Group 49B.
34.Group 50.  This group consists of  two applications proposing service to different 
communities in Florida.  Putnam Radio Ministries, Inc. (PRMI) proposes to serve Keystone Heights, and 
Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. (IFMI) proposes to serve Starke.  Neither applicant claims eligibility for a 
fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
35. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network. 
PRMI and IFMI each certifies that it is entitled to two points for diversity of ownership.  PRMI, however, 
provides no support for its diversity claim, and certifies that it has one existing authorization.  
Accordingly, we do not award points to PRMI under this criterion.64  With respect to technical 
parameters, PRMI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 840 square kilometers with a population 
of 29,383.  IFMI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 925 square kilometers with a population 
62 We note that Triangle Access Broadcasting, Inc. (TABI) filed an Informal Objection to the RBN application.   See 
Pleading  No. 167141.  We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any 
objection if/when the subject application becomes accepted for filing.  We will review the merits of TABI’s 
objection after the tentative selectee’s application is accepted for filing.
63 Group 49, which originally contained 13 applications, was bifurcated as a result of a technical amendment.  The 
other applications in the group were evaluated as Group 49A in a previous order.  See Threshold Fair Distribution 
Analysis of 13 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial 
Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-477, at para. 10 (MB May 2, 2022) (13 Group 
Fair Distribution Order). 
64 We note that even if we were to award PRMI points for diversity of ownership, it would not change the outcome 
of this group.
799Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
of 34,857.  IFMI receives one point under the best technical proposal criterion because it would serve at 
least 10% more area and population than PRMI.  Accordingly, PRMI is not credited with any point, and 
IFMI is credited with a total of three points.  IFMI is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 50.
36.Group 51.  This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same 
community in Florida.  Teleamerica Communications West Palm Beach Corp. (TCW) and Newland 
Broadcasters Incorporated (NBI) each proposes service to Key West.  Because the applicants propose 
service to the same community, TCW and NBI proceed to a point system analysis.
37. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant.  Each applicant claims 
two points for diversity of ownership.  NBI also claims points as a state-wide network.  Such points, 
however, are only available to applicants that do not qualify for two points for diversity of ownership.  
NBI cannot receive points under both criteria.65  With respect to technical parameters, TCW’s proposed 
60 dBu contour would encompass 16 square kilometers with a population of 24,649.  NBI’s proposed 60 
dBu contour would encompass 11 square kilometers with a population of 23,342.  Because neither 
applicant’s proposal would serve at least 10% more area and population than the other, we do not award 
points for this criterion.  Thus, TCW and NBI are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a 
tie-breaker analysis.
38. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  TCW certifies that it has no attributable interests in any radio authorization, and NBI certifies 
that it has an attributable interest in one radio authorization.  TCW therefore prevails based on this first 
tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 51.66
39.Group 54.  This group consists of four applications proposing service to the same 
community in Florida.  Call Communications Group, Inc. (CCGI), Ethree Group, Inc. (EGI), New Media 
Humanity Association Inc. (NMHA), and Central Baptist Church of Ocala Inc. (CBCO) each proposes to 
serve Weeki Wachee.  Because the applicants proposes to serve the same community, they proceed to a 
point system analysis.
40. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant or state-wide 
network.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership with NMHA’s claim based on a 
pledge to divest its LPFM station, WYPW-LP, Brandon, Florida.  With respect to technical parameters, 
CCGI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 847 square kilometers with a population of 110,411.  
EGI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 693 square kilometers with a population of 88,689.  
NMHA’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 668 square kilometers with a population of 97,594.  
CBCO’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 945 square kilometers with a population of 105,470.  
No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant 
proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  Accordingly, CCGI, 
EGI, NMHA, and CBCO are  credited with a total of two points each and proceed to a tie-breaker 
analysis.
41. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  CCGI certifies that it has attributable interests in nine radio authorizations, and CBCO certifies 
that it has attributable interests in two radio authorizations.  EGI and NMHA each certifies that it has no 
65 See 47 CFR §73.7003(b)(3).  Moreover, NBI does not submit any information to support its claim that it qualifies 
as a state-wide network.
66 Between December 20, 2021, to May 11, 2022, NBI filed several petitions to deny the TCW application.  See 
Pleading Nos. 177507, 186288, and 190458.  Because the TCW application has not yet been accepted for filing, the 
NBI petitions are premature and will not be considered at this stage.  We will review the merits of the NBI petitions 
after the TCW application is accepted for filing.
800Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
attributable interest in any radio authorization.  CCGI and CBCO are therefore eliminated, and EGI and 
NMHA proceed to the second tie-breaker – the number of pending radio applications attributable to each 
applicant.  The applicant with the fewest applications prevails.  EGI certifies it  has no pending 
applications, and NMHA certifies it has one pending application.  EGI’s count, however, is inaccurate 
because it does not include the instant application and its six other pending applications.67  After 
accounting for this error and adjustment, NMHA  prevails on the basis of this second tie-breaker and is 
the tentative selectee in Group 54.
42.Group 55.  This group consists of four applications to serve different communities in 
Florida.  Ethree Group, Inc. (EGI) proposes to serve Big Pine; Key West Radio (KWR) and Specialized 
Educational Broadcasting (SEB) each proposes to serve Key West; Frequency Zero, Inc. (FZI) proposes 
to serve Stock Island.  Each applicant certifies that it is not eligible for a fair distribution preference.  
Accordingly, all four applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
43. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant or state-
wide network.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership.  With respect to technical 
parameters, EGI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 312 square kilometers with a population of 
26,234.  KWR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 30 square kilometers with a population of 
29,890.  SEB’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 37 square kilometers with a population of 
29,550.  FZI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 33 square kilometers with a population of 
31,066.  No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant 
proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  Accordingly, EGI, 
KWR, SEB, and FZI are each credited with a total of two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
44. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  Each applicant certifies that it has no attributable interest in any radio authorization.  All four 
applicants, therefore, proceed to the second tie-breaker – the number of pending radio applications 
attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest applications prevails.  EGI certifies it  has no 
pending applications; KWR certifies it has one pending application; SEB certifies that it has five pending 
applications; FZI certifies it has two pending applications.  EGI’s count, however, is inaccurate because it 
does not include the instant application and its six other pending applications.68  After accounting for this 
error and adjustment,  KWR has the fewest pending applications, and is therefore, the tentative selectee in 
Group 55.
45.Group 63.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to the same 
community in Georgia.  Inverse Focus Ministry, Inc. (IFM), Frequency Zero, Inc. (FZI), and Sanctuary 
Church (SC) each proposes to serve Darien.  Because each applicant proposes to serve the same 
community, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
46. SC claims that it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant; IFM and FZI 
do not claim points under this criterion.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership with 
SC’s claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station WWZR-LP, Brunswick, Georgia. No applicant 
claims that it qualifies for points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, IFM’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,018 square kilometers with a population of 59,210.  FZI’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 348 square kilometers with a population of 36,249.  SC’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 667 square kilometers with a population of 54,575.  No 
applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to 
serve at least 10% more area and population than another.  Accordingly, SC is credited with a total of five 
67 See File Nos. 166667, 166680, 166720, 166738, 167098, 167113, and 167131.
68 See File Nos. 166667, 166680, 166720, 166738, 167098, 167113, and 167131.
801Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
points, and IFM and FZI are each credited with two points.  SC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in 
Group 63.
47.Group 79.  This group consists of seven applications proposing service to four different 
communities in Iowa.  Friendship Baptist Church (FBC), Bible Broadcasting Network, Inc. (BBN), 
Community Public Radio, Inc. (CPR), and Calvary Chapel Iowa (CCI) each proposes to serve Cedar 
Rapids.  Rising Tide Broadcasting, Inc. (RTB) proposes to serve Center Point.  Vida Ministry Inc. (VM) 
proposes to serve Marion, and Extend the Dream Foundation (EDF) proposes to serve Swisher.  Each 
applicant certifies that it is not eligible for a fair distribution preference, and accordingly, all seven 
applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
48. FBC, CCI, and EDF each claims that it qualifies for three points as an established local 
applicant.  BBN, CPR, RTB, and FM do not claim points under this criterion.  Each applicant claims two 
points for diversity of ownership with CCI’s claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KEWR-LP, 
Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and EDF’s claim based on a pledge to divest KICI-LP, Iowa City, Iowa.  No 
applicant claims that it qualifies for points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, 
the applicants’ proposed 60 dBu contours would encompass areas and populations as follows:  FBC, 
1,598 square kilometers with a population of 207,189; BBN, 1,551 square kilometers with a population of 
205,737; CPR, 4,034 square kilometers with a population of 250,043; CCI, 2,008 square kilometers with 
a population of 217,630; RTB, 2,011 square kilometers with a population of 211,469; VM, 2,685 square 
kilometers with a population of 231,036; and  EDF, 2,846 square kilometers with a population of 
230,891.  No applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no 
applicant proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  
Accordingly, FBC, CCI, and EDF are each credited with a total of five points; BBN, CPR, RTB, and VM 
are each credited with two points.  FBC, CCI, and EDF, therefore, proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
49. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  Each applicant certifies that it has no attributable interest in any radio authorization.69  
Accordingly, FBC, CCI, and EDF proceed to the second tie-breaker – the number of pending radio 
applications attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest applications prevails.  FBC and 
EDF each certifies it has one pending application, and CCI certifies it has no pending applications.  
Applicants, however, were required to count the application at issue when reporting their pending 
applications.  Therefore, “one” pending application is the lowest possible number of pending applications 
that can be specified correctly on the Schedule 340.70  With this adjustment, FBC, CCI, and EDF remain 
tied and proceed to a third tie-breaker - prior NCE applications.
50. The tentative selectee will be the applicant that can demonstrate that: (1) it applied in a 
previous filing window, and had its application accepted for filing and processed, but subsequently 
dismissed in favor of an applicant possessing superior points or a tie-breaker showing; (2) it was in 
continuous existence as a legal entity at all times from the date of the previous NCE window filing until 
the present; and (3) it does not hold any NCE construction permit or license.  No applicant certifies that it 
satisfies this final tie-breaker criterion.  Accordingly, FBC, CCI, and EDF are all the tentative selectees 
69 CCI and EDF pledge to divest their current LPFM stations, and accordingly, were not required to count these 
stations as existing authorizations.  See Schedule 340, Point System/Tie-breakers Section, Existing Authorizations 
("Radio applicants should count all attributable full service radio stations, AM and FM, commercial and 
noncommercial, and FM translator stations other than fill-in stations or those identified in the second question 
(pledge to divest an attributable broadcast interest/resign from an attributable positional interest) under Diversity of 
Ownership”).
70 See NCE Filing Procedures Public Notice, supra note 24 (“When reporting pending applications, applicants must 
include new and major change radio applications, including the subject application and all other applications filed in 
this window by the Application Deadline.”).

for Group 79, and, we direct the applicants  to submit, within 90 days of the release of the Order, a 
voluntary time-sharing agreement.
51.Group 83.71  This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same 
community in Idaho.  First Baptist Church of Riverview (FBCR) and Salt & Light Radio, Inc. (SLRI) 
each proposes to serve Mountain Home.  Because the applicants propose service to the same community, 
FBCR and SLRI proceed to a point system analysis.
52. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  
Each applicant certifies that it is entitled to two points for diversity of ownership.  With respect to 
technical parameters, FBCR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,815 square kilometers with a 
population of 25,104.  SLRI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,809 square kilometers with a 
population of 23,846.  Because neither applicant’s proposal would serve at least 10% more area and 
population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion.  Accordingly, FBCR and SLRI are 
each credited with two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
53. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  FBCR certifies that it has attributable interests in seven radio authorizations, and SLRI certifies 
that it has five radio attributable interests.  Accordingly, SLRI is the tentative selectees in Group 83. 
54.Group 92.  This group consists of four applications to serve different communities in 
Illinois and Indiana.  Covenant Network (CN) and 2820 Communications Inc. (2820) each proposes to 
serve Danville, Illinois. Appalachian Educational Communication Corporation (AECC) proposes to serve 
Paris, Illinois, and Olivet Nazarene University (ONU) proposes to serve Wingate, Indiana.  Each 
applicant certifies that it is not eligible for a fair distribution preference, and accordingly, all four 
applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
55. No applicant claims that it qualifies for points as an established local applicant or state-
wide network.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership.  However, because CN and 
2820 did not submit documentation to support this claim, we cannot award either applicant points under 
this criterion.72  With respect to technical parameters, CN’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 
402 square kilometers with a population of 16,197.  2820’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 
2,375 square kilometers with a population of 85,330.  AECC’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
encompass 1,272 square kilometers with a population of 18,443.  ONU’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
encompass 1,620 square kilometers with a population of 35,227.  2820 is eligible for two points under the 
71 Group 83 was analyzed in a previous point system order, and First Baptist Church of Riverview (FBCR) was 
declared the tentative selectee.  See Comparative Consideration of 32 Groups of Mutually Exclusive Applications for 
Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, Memorandum Opinion and Order, FCC 22-78 
(rel. Oct. 25, 2022).  On November 1, 2022, FBCR notified Bureau staff that it had prepared an amendment to 
update its count of existing authorizations to reflect recent grants and assignments, all of which had occurred prior to 
the October 25, 2022, release of the point order, but inadvertently neglected to file the amendment.  Therefore, on 
November 1, 2022, FBCR concurrently filed its amendment to update its count of existing authorizations.  On 
November 25, 2022, Salt & Light Radio, Inc. filed a petition to deny the FBCR application (SLRI Petition), 
asserting that FBCR’s recent  amendment changes the result of the previous point system analysis and “had the 
information now available to the agency staff been before the staff when the Order was released 30 days ago, the 
staff would have tentatively selected Salt & Light’s competing application.”  See Pleading No. 204286.  FBCR did 
not file an opposition to the SLRI Petition.  The initial tentative selection of the FBCR application was an 
interlocutory decision, not a final action on the two applications in Group 83, and therefore, can be modified or 
rescinded when, as the case here, new facts arise which demonstrate the tentative selection was made without 
accurate data, and therefore, wrong.  We, therefore, re-analyze Group 83 herein and dismiss the SLRI Petition as 
moot.  
72 CN and 2820 each hold attributable interests in Illinois and/or nearby states.  Each applicant neglected to submit a 
statement that there is no overlap with the proposed station.
803Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
best technical proposal criterion because it proposes to serve at least 25% more area and population than 
each other applicant.  Accordingly, CN is not credited with any points.  2820, AECC, and ONU are each 
credited with two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
56. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  2820 certifies that it has an attributable interest in nine radio authorizations, AECC in five, and 
ONU in seven.  Accordingly, AECC is the tentative selectee for Group 92.
57.Group 106.  This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same 
community in Rhode Island.  Radio Sharon Foundation (RSF) and Horizon Christian Fellowship (HCF) 
each proposes to serve Narragansett Pier.  Because the applicants propose to serve the same community,  
RSF and HCF proceed to a point system analysis.
58. RSF certifies that it is entitled to three points as an established local applicant.  HCF does 
not claim points under this criterion.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership.  
Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, RSF’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 203 square kilometers with a population of 49,310 people.  
HCF’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 976 square kilometers with a population of 59,822 
people.  HCF is eligible for one point under the best technical proposal criterion because it proposes to 
serve at least 10% more area and population than RSF.  Accordingly, RSF is credited with a total of five 
points, and HCF is credited with a total of three points. Thus, RSF is the tentative selectee in Group 106.
59.Group 124.  This group consists of six applications to serve different communities in 
Minnesota.  Southern Minnesota Catholic Radio has two applications in the group, one for Mankato 
(SMCR-Mankato) and one for Waseca (SMCR-Waseca).  The other applicants are:  Minnesota State 
University, Mankato (MSUM), One Day Church Project, Inc. (ODCPI), and Fairmont Area Catholic 
Radio (FACR), each for Mankato; and Minn-Iowa Christian Broadcasting Inc. (MICBI) for Mapleton.  
No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, the six applicants proceed 
to a point system analysis.
60. MSUM and MICBI each claim three points as an established local applicant.  The other 
four applicants do not claim points under this criterion.  ODCPI, SMCR-Mankato, FACR, and SMCR-
Waseca each claim two points for diversity of ownership, with ODCPI’s claim based on a pledge to divest 
LPFM station KCJL-LP, Dodge Center, Minnesota, and with FACR’s claim based on a pledge to divest 
LPFM station KYEJ￿LP, Fairmont, Minnesota.  MSUM and MICBI do not claim diversity points.  No 
applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, each applicant’s 
proposed 60 dBu contours would encompass areas and populations as follows:  MSUM, 4,352 square 
kilometers with a population of 120,672; ODCPI, 4,951 square kilometers with a population of 133,200;  
SMCR-Mankato, 755 square kilometers with a population of 70,902; FACR, 1,104 square kilometers 
with a population of 76,602; MICBI, 756 square kilometers with a population of 6,485; and SMCR-
Waseca, 617 square kilometers with a population of 25,524.  ODCPI is credited with one point under the 
best technical proposal criterion because its proposal will serve at least 10% more area and population 
than MSUM’s next best proposal.  Accordingly, SMCR-Mankato, FACR, and SMCR-Waseca are each 
credited with a total of two points; MSUM, MICBI, and ODCPI are each credited with a total of three 
points and therefore proceed to the tie-breaker analysis.
61. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails.  
MSUM certifies that it has attributable interests in three radio authorizations.  MICBI certifies that it has 
attributable interests in 25 radio authorizations, and ODCPI certifies it has no attributable radio 
authorizations.  ODCPI therefore prevails based on this first tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in 
Group 124.
804Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
62.Group 137B.73  This group consists of three applications to serve different communities 
in North Carolina.  Hitquake Community Radio Network (HCRN) proposes to serve Glencoe.  Church 
Planters of America (CPA) proposes to serve McLeansville, and Hispanic American Christian Network, 
Inc. (HACNI) proposes to serve Sedalia.  No applicant claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference. 
Accordingly, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
63. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  Each 
applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership.  With respect to technical parameters, HCRN’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 129 square kilometers with a population of 31,147.  CPA’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 305 square kilometers with a population of 47,401.  HACNI 
did not provide information regarding its proposed 60 dBu contour or population served, and is therefore 
not included in our analysis for the best technical proposal.  CPA qualifies for two points as the best 
technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 25% more area and population than the HCRN 
proposal.  Accordingly, HCRN and HACNI are each credited with two points.  CPA is credited with a 
total of four points, and is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 137B.
64.Group 137C.74  This group consists of three applications to serve the same community in 
Virginia.  Positive Alternative Radio, Inc. (PARI), Church Planters of America (CPA), and Hitquake 
Community Radio Network (HCRN) all propose to serve Danville.  Because each applicant proposes to 
serve the same community, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
65. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  CPA 
and HCRN each claim two points for diversity of ownership; PARI does not.  With respect to technical 
parameters, PARI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 351 square kilometers with a population 
of 59,098.  CPA’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 665 square kilometers with a population of 
60,139.  HCRN’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 813 square kilometers with a population of 
72,547.  HCRN qualifies for one point under the best technical proposal criterion because its proposal 
would serve at least 10% more area and population than CPA’s next best proposal.  Accordingly, PARI is 
not credited with any points, CPA is credited with two points, and HCRN is credited with a total of three 
points.  HCRN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 137C.
66.Group 144.  This group consists of four applications to serve different communities in 
New Jersey.  Radio Vision Cristiana Management Corporation (RVCMC) proposes to serve Brick.  
Rejuvenation Outreach Center Inc. (ROCI) and Community Public Radio, Inc. (CPRI) each proposes to 
serve Lakewood.  Cantico Nuevo Ministry, Inc. (CNMI) proposes to serve Leisure Village.  No applicant 
claims eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, the four applicants proceed to a point 
system analysis.
67. CNMI claims three points as an established local applicant, but did not submit 
documentation to support its claim.  Accordingly, we will not award CNMI the three localism points.  
RVCMC, ROCI, and CPRI do not claim points under this criterion.  RVCMC, ROCI, and CPRI claim 
two points for diversity of ownership; CNMI does not.  CNMI claims two points as a state-wide network, 
but did not submit documentation to support its claim.  Accordingly, we will not award CNMI the two 
points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, RVCMC’s proposed 60 dBu 
contour would encompass 520 square kilometers with a population of 392,195.  ROCI’s proposed 60 dBu 
contour would encompass 113 square kilometers with a population of 126,118.75  CPRI’s proposed 60 
73 Group 137, which originally consisted of 16 applications, was divided into three sub-groups as a result of a 
technical amendment.  Groups 137B and 137C  are evaluated herein.  The applications in Group 137A were 
evaluated in a previous order.  See 13 Group Fair Distribution Order, supra note 63.
74 See supra note 73.
75 On December 23, 2021, ROCI amended its application to increase its proposed area to 116.5 square kilometers 
and its proposed population to 130,531.  Because the amendment was filed after the close of the filing window, we 
(continued….)
805Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
dBu contour would encompass 534 square kilometers with a population of 396,270.  CNMI’s proposed 60 
dBu contour would encompass 173 square kilometers with a population of 128,350.  No applicant is 
eligible for any points under the best technical proposal criterion because no proposal will serve at least 
10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  Accordingly, CNMI is not credited with any 
points; RVCMC, ROCI, and CPRI are each credited with two points and proceed to the tie-breaker 
analysis.
68. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant. The applicant with the fewest authorizations prevails.  
RVCMC certifies that it has attributable interests in five radio authorizations.  ROCI certifies that it has 
no attributable radio interests.  CPRI certifies that it has attributable interests in one radio authorization.  
ROCI therefore prevails based on this first tie-breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 144.
69.Group 145.  This group consists of five applications to serve different communities in 
New Jersey.  Casa de Destino (CDD) and Calvary Chapel Morris Hills (CCMH) each proposes to serve 
Bernardsville; Redeemer Broadcasting, Inc. (RBI) proposes to serve Mendham; Transmission 
Communications Network (TCN) proposes to serve Millington; and Cantico Nuevo Ministry, Inc. (CNM) 
proposes to serve Watchung.  CDD, CCMH, and RBI each claim eligibility for a fair distribution 
preference.76  TCN and CNM do not claim eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  Although CDD 
certifies that it is eligible for a fair distribution preference, it failed to timely provide sufficient 
documentation to support its claim in its original application.77  Accordingly, TCN, CNM, and CDD are 
each eliminated.  CCMH claims to provide new first NCE service to 36,190 people; RBI to 38,643 
people.  The proposals of CCMH and RBI are comparable because neither proposal exceeds the other by 
at least 5,000 people.  Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population 
totals.  CCMH would provide a first or second NCE service to 83,722 people (36,190 first service plus 
47,532 second service); RBI to 88,378 people (38,643 first service plus 49,735 second service).  Because 
the CCMH and RBI applications are still comparable, CCMH and RBI proceed to a point system analysis.
70. CCMH claims three points as an established local applicant; RBI does not.  Both CCMH 
and RBI claim two points for diversity of ownership, with CCMH’s claim based on a pledge to divest 
LPFM station WCFT-LP, Dover, New Jersey.  Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  
With respect to technical parameters, CCMH’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 431 square 
kilometers with a population of 177,699.  RBI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 457 square 
kilometers with a population of 157,527.  Because neither applicant’s proposal would serve at least 10% 
more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion.  Accordingly, CCMH 
do not consider it.  We have repeatedly disallowed the enhancement of qualifications in NCE comparative cases, 
consistent with section 73.7003(e) of the rules.  See 47 CFR §73.7003(e).   
76 See File Nos. 167880, 167028, and 166759, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  CDD’s 
60 dBu contour encompasses 134,947 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE service is 75,634 
people.  CCMH’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 177,699 people, and its claimed aggregated first and second NCE 
service is 83,722 people.  RBI’s 60 dBu contour encompasses 157,527 people, and its claimed aggregated first and 
second NCE service is 88,378 people.  Thus, each applicant would provide a combined first and second NCE service 
to at least 10% of the population within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people. 
77 See File No. 167880, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  In CDD’s original application, 
submitted on November 9, 2021, it did not certify that it would provide a first or second NCE service, nor did it 
attach the required documentation.  CDD submitted an amendment to the original application on January 24, 2022, 
that “corrects the [fair distribution of service] certifications and supplies the required supporting documentation.”  
Id.  We find that CDD’s amended application, which claimed fair distribution preference for the first time, was a 
prohibited attempt to enhance its comparative position, and will therefore not be considered.  
806Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
is credited with a total of five points, and RBI is credited with a total of two points.  CCMH is, therefore, 
the tentative selectee in Group 145.78
71.Group 153.  This group consists of three applications to serve the same community in 
New Mexico.  Off the Cuff Educational Broadcasting (OTCEB), City of Hobbs, NM (CHN), and The 
Association for Community Education, Inc. (AFCEI) all propose to serve Hobbs.   Because each applicant 
proposes to serve the same community, the three applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
72. CHN claims three points as an established local applicant; OTCEB and AFCEI do not 
claim localism points.  CHN and AFCEI each claim two points for diversity of ownership, with CHN’s 
claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KHBX-LP, Hobbs, New Mexico.  OTCEB does not 
claim points under this criterion.  No applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to 
technical parameters, OTCEB’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 484 square kilometers with a 
population of 34,628.  CHN’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,304 square kilometers with a 
population of 44,280.  AFCEI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 495 square kilometers with a 
population of 42,589.  No applicant is eligible for any points under the best technical proposal criterion 
because no proposal will serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  
Accordingly, OTCEB is not credited with any points, CHN is credited with five points, and AFCEI is 
credited with two points.  CHN is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 153.
73.Group 156.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to the same 
community in New Mexico.  Northern New Mexico Radio Foundation (NMRF), The Association for 
Community Education, Inc. (ACE), and The Rock Christian Outreach of Las Vegas (RCLV) each 
proposes to serve Las Vegas.  Because the applicants propose service to the same community, NMRF, 
ACE, and RCLV proceed to a point system analysis.
74. RCLV claims it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant.  NMRF and 
ACE do not claim points under this criterion.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of 
ownership, with RCLV’s claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KLYN-LP, Las Vegas, New 
Mexico.  No applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, 
NMRF’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 339 square kilometers with a population of 18,311.  
ACE’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 548 square kilometers with a population of 18,938.  
RCLV’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 390 square kilometers with a population of 18,476.  
No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes 
to serve least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  Accordingly, RCLV is credited 
with a total of five points.  NMRF and ACE are each credited with two points.  Thus, RCLV is the 
tentative selectee in Group 156.
75.Group 174.  This group consists of two applications proposing service to the same 
community in Oklahoma.  Woodward Catholic Radio, Inc. (WCR) and Great Plains Christian Radio, Inc. 
(GPCR) each proposes to serve Woodward.  Because the applicants propose to serve the same 
community, WCR and GPCR proceed to a point system analysis.
76. WCR claims that it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant.  GPCR 
does not claim points under this criterion.  WCR also claims two points for diversity of ownership based 
on its pledge to divest LPFM station, KFPP-LP, Woodward, Oklahoma.  GPCR does not claim diversity 
points.  Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, 
WCR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,248 square kilometers with a population of 17,400.  
78 On January 7, 2022, RBI filed an Informal Objection to the CCMH’s application.  See Pleading No. 179137.  We 
generally do not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection if/when the subject 
application becomes accepted for filing.  We will review the merits of RBI’s objection after the tentative selectee’s 
application is accepted for filing.
807Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
GPCR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,212 square kilometers with a population of 18,652.  
Neither applicant is eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because neither proposes 
to serve at least 10% more area and population than the other.  Accordingly, WCR is credited with a total 
of five points, and GPCR is not credited with any points.  WCR is, therefore, the tentative selectee in 
Group 174.
77.Group 177.  This group consists of three applications to serve three different 
communities in Oklahoma.  Outside the Doors Ministry Foundation (ODMF) proposes to serve Altus, 
Western Oklahoma Catholic Faith Foundation (WOCF) proposes to serve Elk City, and Top O' Texas 
Educational Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. (TEBF) proposes to serve Sayre.  No applicant claims 
eligibility for a fair distribution preference.79  ODMF, WOCF, and TEBF, therefore, proceed to a point 
system analysis.
78. WOCF claims it qualifies for three points as an established local applicant.  ODMF and 
TEBF do not claim points under this criterion.  ODMF and WOCF each claim two points for diversity of 
ownership, with WOCF’s claim based on a pledge to divest LPFM station KPFS￿LP, Elk City, 
Oklahoma.  TEBF certifies that it is not entitled to diversity points.  ODMF also claims points as a state-
wide network.  Such points, however, are only available to applicants that do not qualify for two points 
for diversity of ownership.  ODMF cannot claim points under both criteria.80  With respect to technical 
parameters, ODMF’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 985 square kilometers with a 
population of 26,084.  WOCF’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 4,419 square kilometers with 
a population of 23,870.  TEBF’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 2,176 square kilometers 
with a population of 8,115.  No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion 
because no applicant proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  
Accordingly, ODMF is credited with a total of two points, WOCF is credited with five points, and TEBF 
is not credited with any points.  Thus, WOCF is the tentative selectee in Group 177.
79.Group 181.  This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in 
Oregon.  Coos Commons Protection Council (CCPC) and Southern Oregon University (SOU) each 
propose to serve Bandon.  Because each applicant proposes to serve the same community, the applicants 
proceed to a point system analysis.
80. CCPC and SOU each claim three points as an established local applicant.  CCPC and 
SOU also each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  SOU certifies that its diversity claim is based 
on a divestiture pledge, but it neglects to provide such a pledge or submit any information to support its 
claim.  Accordingly, we will not award SOU points under this criterion.  Neither applicant claims points 
as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, CCPC’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
encompass 1,410 square kilometers with a population of 11,439.  SOU’s proposed 60 dBu contour would 
encompass 1,306 square kilometers with a population of 11,040.  Because neither applicant’s proposal 
would serve at least 10% more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this 
79 See File No. 167817, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  In its initial application, 
WOCF claimed eligibility for a fair distribution preference based on first and second NCE service population totals 
and was named the tentative selectee of Group 177.  See Threshold Fair Distribution Analysis of 19 Groups of 
Mutually Exclusive Applications for Permits to Construct New Noncommercial Educational FM Stations, 
Memorandum Opinion and Order, DA 22-314 (MB Mar. 24, 2022).  On April 22, 2022, WOCF filed an amendment 
to its application to disclaim its eligibility for a fair distribution preference.  The initial tentative selection of the 
WOCF application was an interlocutory decision, not a final action on the three applications in Group 177, and 
therefore, can be modified or rescinded when, as the case here, facts arise which nullify the previous fair distribution 
analysis.  In any event, WOCF remains the tentative selectee based on application of the established criteria as 
outlined above.   
80 See 47 CFR § 73.7003(b)(3).  Moreover, ODMF does not submit any information to support its claim that it 
qualifies as a state-wide network.
808Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
criterion.  Accordingly, CCPC is credited with a total of five points, and SOU is credited with a total of 
three points.  CCPC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 181.
81.Group 184.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to the same 
community in Oregon.  First Baptist Church of Riverview (FBCR), Idaho Conference of Seventh-Day 
Adventists, Inc. (ICSA), and Baker Art Guild (BAG) each proposes to serve Baker City.  Because the 
applicants propose service to the same community, FBCR, ICSA, and BAG proceed to a point system 
analysis.
82. ICSA and BAG each claim three points as an established local applicant.  FBCR does not 
claim points under this criterion.  FBCR and BAG claim two points each for diversity of ownership; 
ICSA does not.  No applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical 
parameters, FBCR’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 507 square kilometers with a population 
of 10,865.  ICSA’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 562 square kilometers with a population 
of 11,985.  BAG’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,307 square kilometers with a population 
of 13,193.  BAG qualifies for one point under the best technical proposal criterion because its proposal 
would serve at least 10% more area and population than ICSA’s next best proposal.  Accordingly, BAG is 
credited with a total of six points, ICSA is credited with three points, and FBCR is credited with two 
points.  BAG is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 184.
83.Group 185.  This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Oregon.  
Ondas de Vida, Inc. (ODVI) and Modoc Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) each proposes to serve 
Altamont.  Because the applicants propose to serve the same community, ODVI and MBC proceed to a 
point system analysis.
84. MBC claims three points as an established local applicant; ODVI does not.  ODVI and MBC 
each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  ODVI, however, certifies that it has 10 existing 
authorizations and does not submit documentation to support its diversity claim.81  Accordingly, we will 
not award ODVI points under this criterion.  Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  
With respect to technical parameters, ODVI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 162 square 
kilometers with a population of 37,281.  MBC’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 2,833 square 
kilometers with a population of 26,633.  Because neither applicant’s proposal would serve at least 10% 
more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion.  Accordingly, ODVI is 
not credited with any points, and MBC is credited with a total of five points.  MBC is, therefore, the 
tentative selectee in Group 185.         
85.Group 192.  This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Texas.  
Hallettsville Right to Life, Inc. (HRLI) and Vida Ministry Inc. (VMI) each proposes to serve Hallettsville.  
Because HRLI and VMI propose to serve the same community, the applicants proceed to a point system 
analysis.
86. HRLI claims three points as an established local applicant; VMI does not.  HRLI and VMI 
each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  Neither applicant claims points as a state-wide network.  
With respect to technical parameters, HRLI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,541 square 
kilometers with a population of 27,122.  VMI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,752 square 
kilometers with a population of 13,792.  Neither applicant qualifies for any points under the best technical 
proposal criterion because neither proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than the other.  
Accordingly, HRLI is credited with a total of five points, and VMI is credited with two points.  HRLI is, 
therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 192.
81 We note that even if we were to award ODVI points for diversity of ownership, it would not change the outcome 
of this group.
809Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
87.Group 198.  This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in Texas.  
Vida Ministry Inc. (VMI) and Ixoye Productions, Inc. (IPI) each proposes to serve Thorndale.  Because 
VMI and IPI propose to serve the same community, the applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
88. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  VMI 
and IPI each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  With respect to technical parameters, VMI’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 440 square kilometers with a population of 3,462.  IPI’s 
proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 150 square kilometers with a population of 2,129.  VMI 
qualifies for two points as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 25% more area 
and population than the IPI proposal.  Accordingly, VMI is credited with a total of four points, and IPI is 
credited with two points.  VMI is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 198.
89.Group 200.  This group consists of four applications proposing service to three different 
communities in Texas.  Call Communications Group, Inc. (CCGI) proposes to serve Beaumont.  Vida 
Ministry Inc. (VMI) proposes to serve Central Gardens.  Christian Ministries of the Valley, Inc. (CMV) 
and CCS Radio, Inc. (CCSR) each proposes to serve Port Arthur.  No applicant claims eligibility for a fair 
distribution preference.  Accordingly, the four applicants proceed to a point system analysis.
90. No applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  CCGI 
and VMI each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  CMV and CCSR do not claim points under 
this criterion.  With respect to technical parameters, CCGI’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 
1,157 square kilometers with a population of 218,225; VMI, 539 square kilometers and 114,876 people; 
CMV, 1,882 square kilometers and 221,770 people; and CCSR, 1,402 square kilometers and 108,218 
people.  No applicant qualifies for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant 
proposes to serve at least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  Accordingly, CMV 
and CCSR are not credited with any points.  CCGI and VMI are each credited with a total of two points 
and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
91. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  VMI certifies that it has no attributable interests in any radio authorization, and CCGI certifies 
that it has attributable interests in nine radio authorizations.  VMI therefore prevails based on this first tie-
breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 200.
92.Group 201.  This group consists of five applications to serve five different communities 
in Texas.  Radio Inc. (RI) proposes to serve Ballinger.  The other applicants are: La Promesa Foundation 
(LPF) for Brady; Hispanic American Christian Network, Inc. (HACN) for El Dorado; Sun Radio 
Foundation (SRF) for Mason; and Centro Cristiano de Vida Eterna San Antonio (CCSA) for Rock 
Springs.  LPF and CCSA each claim eligibility for a first NCE service fair distribution preference. 82   RI, 
HACN, and SRF do not claim eligibility for a first NCE service fair distribution preference.  Accordingly, 
RI, HACN, and SRF are each eliminated.  We note that Albert David (David) filed an Informal Objection 
(Objection) to the CCSA application,83 asserting that CCSA’s population figures in support of its fair 
distribution claim are unreliable because it failed to consider NCE FM stations KKER(FM), Kerrville, 
Texas, and KTXI(FM), Ingram, Texas.  CCSA, however, amended its application to account for these 
82 See File Nos. 167328 and 167127, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  LPF claims that it 
would provide first NCE service to 6,907 of the 6,907 people encompassed within its 60 dBu contour, and CCSA to 
5,470 of the 5,529 people.  Thus, each applicant would provide first NCE service to at least 10% of the population 
within its 60 dBu contour and to more than 2,000 people.
83 See Pleading No. 184828 (filed February 15, 2022).  We generally do not consider objections at this stage, but 
rather, review the merits of any objection if/when the subject application becomes accepted for filing.  Here, we 
dismiss David’s Objection to the CCSA application as moot because CCSA amended its application to correct and 
update its population data in response to the Objection. 
810Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
stations and correct and update its population data.84  Accordingly, we dismiss the David Objection as 
moot.85
93. LPF claims to provide new first NCE service to 6,907 people, and CCSA to 5,470 people.  
The applications are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people.  Accordingly, 
we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals.  LPF claims to provide combined 
first and second service to 6,907 people (all first service); CCSA to 5,483 (5,470 first service plus 13 
second service).   The applications are still comparable, and therefore, LPF and CCSA proceed to a point 
system analysis.
94. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  
LPF and CCSA each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  With respect to technical parameters, 
LPF’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 1,468 square kilometers with a population of 6,907.  
CCSA’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 6,518 square kilometers with a population of 5,529.  
Because neither applicant’s proposal would serve at least 10% more area and population than the other, 
we do not award points for this criterion.  Accordingly, LPF and CCSA are each credited with a total of 
two points and proceed to a tie-breaker analysis.
95. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  LPF certifies that it has attributable interests in 32 radio authorizations, and CCSA certifies that 
it has attributable interests in ten radio authorizations.  CCSA therefore prevails based on this first tie-
breaker and is the tentative selectee in Group 201.
96.Group 206.  This group consists of two applications to serve the same community in 
Utah.  Castle Valley Inc. (CVI) and University of Utah (UU) each propose to serve Moab.  Because the 
applicants proposes to serve the same community, CVI and UU proceed to a point system analysis.
97. CVI and UU each claim three points as an established local applicant, but CVI does not 
submit documentation to support its claim.  Accordingly, we will not award CVI points under this 
criterion.86  CVI and UU each claim two points for diversity of ownership with CVI’s claim based on a 
pledge to divest LPFM station KCVD-LP, Castle Valley, Utah and  UU’s claim based on a pledge to 
divest FM translator stations K219KR, Moab, Utah, and K215EL, North Moab, Utah.  Neither applicant 
claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, UU’s proposed 60 dBu 
contour would encompass 4,995 square kilometers with a population of 9,850.  CVI’s proposed 60 dBu 
contour would include a population of 8,379.  CVI does not provide information regarding its proposed 
area served.  To allow us to compare the proposals, and not unfairly disadvantage UU, we will only 
consider the proposed population served.  We therefore award UU one point under the best technical 
84 See File No. 167127 (amended February 16, 2022); see also CCSA Opposition to Objection, Pleading No. 189092 
(filed April 8, 2022).  CCSA’s amendment reduced its first NCE service population count from 5,529 to 5,470 
people.    
85 In his Reply to CCSA’s Opposition, David acknowledges that CCSA corrected the population figures and states 
that he “does not object to the amended figures being used in a determination of a fair distribution preference.”  See 
Pleading No. 189432 (filed April 18, 2022).  David, however, argues that the initial inaccurate figures “appears to 
qualify as a willful false statement,” and the subsequent correction “does not appear to nullify what was committed 
in the first place.”  Id.  We disagree.  Although it is undisputed that CCSA made a mistake in its initial population 
count, a mistake standing alone is not a misrepresentation.  In this case, there is no evidence of any intent to deceive.  
See, e.g., Fox River Broadcasting, Order, 93 FCC 23 127 (1983).    
86 We note that even if we were to award CVI points as an established local applicant, it would not change the 
outcome of this group.
811Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
proposal criterion because it proposes to serve at least 10% more population than the CVI proposal.87 
Accordingly, UU is credited with a total of six points, and CVI is credited with a total of two points.  UU 
is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 206.
98.Group 219.  This group consists of three applications proposing service to two different 
communities in Washington.  Iglesia Case de Milagros (ICM) proposes to serve Leavenworth.  Upper 
Columbia Mission Society of Seventh-Day Adventists (UPMS) and First Baptist Church of Riverview 
(FBC) each proposes to serve Wenatchee.  No applicant claims a fair distribution preference. 
Accordingly, ICM, UPMS and FBC proceed to a point system analysis.
99. UPMS claims three points as an established local applicant; ICM and FBC do not claim 
points under this criterion.  Each applicant claims two points for diversity of ownership.  No applicant 
claims points as a state-wide network.  With respect to technical parameters, ICM’s proposed 60 dBu 
contour would encompass 1,666 square kilometers with a population of 72,249.  UPMS’s proposed 60 
dBu contour would encompass 294 square kilometers with a population of 67,368.  FBC’s proposed 60 
dBu contour would encompass 172 square kilometers with a population of 64,836.  No applicant is 
eligible for points under the best technical proposal criterion because no applicant proposes to serve at 
least 10% more area and population than the next best proposal.  Thus, UPMS is credited with a total of  
five points, and ICM and FBC are each credited with two points.  Accordingly, UPMS is the tentative 
selectee in Group 219.
100.Group 220.  This group consists of two applications to serve different communities in 
Washington.  Iglesia Casa de Milagros (ICM) proposes to serve Chelan, and Northwest Communities 
Education Center (NCEC) proposes to serve Manson.  Neither applicant claims eligibility for a fair 
distribution preference.  Accordingly, ICM and NCEC proceed to a point system analysis.
101. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  
ICM and NCEC claim two points each for diversity of ownership.  With respect to technical parameters, 
ICM’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 817 square kilometers with a population of 10,451.  
NCEC’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 993 square kilometers with a population of 13,307.  
NCEC qualifies for one point as the best technical proposal because it proposes to serve at least 10% 
more area and population than the ICM proposal.  Accordingly, ICM is credited with two points, and 
NCEC is credited with a total of three points.  NCEC is, therefore, the tentative selectee in Group 220.
102.Group 223.  This group consists of eight applications to serve different communities in 
Wisconsin.  The Salvation Poem Foundation, Inc. (SPF) proposes to serve Cedar Grove.  Call 
Communications Group, Inc. (Call) proposes to serve Eden.  Educational Media Foundation (EMF) 
proposes to serve Fond Du Lac.  State of Wisconsin - Educational Communications Board (State) 
proposes to serve Plymouth.  Vanguard Association of Sunbelt Colleges Corporation (Vanguard) 
proposes to serve Rosendale.  Immanuel Bible Church (Immanuel) proposes to serve Sheboygan.  Finally, 
Waupun Baptist Church (Waupun) and Wrvm, Inc. (WRVM) each proposes to serve Waupun.  SPF, 
Vanguard, and WRVM each claims eligibility for a fair distribution of service preference based on first 
NCE service population totals.88  The other applicants do not.  Accordingly, Call, EMF, State, Immanuel, 
and Waupun are each eliminated.  SPF would provide a first NCE service to 2,929 people; Vanguard to 
18,092 people; and WRVM to 19,906 people.  Because Vanguard and WRVM would each provide a first 
87 We note that even if, due to CVI’s incomplete application, we did not compare the proposals and award points 
under the best technical proposal criterion, it would not change the outcome of the group.  UU would remain the 
tentative selectee for Group 206.
88 See File Nos. 167767, 167734, and 166135, Fair Distribution of Service Section, and associated exhibits.  SPF 
claims that it would provide a first NCE service to 2,929 of the 27,330 people within its proposed 60 dBu contour; 
Vanguard to 18,092 of the 163,678 people; and WRVM to 19,906 of the 170,548 people within its proposed 60 dBu 
contour.  Thus, each applicant would provide first NCE service to at least 10% of the population within its 60 dBu 
contour and to more than 2,000 people.
812Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
NCE service to at least 5,000 more people than SPF, SPF  is eliminated.  The Vanguard and WRVM first 
service proposals are comparable because neither exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people.  
Accordingly, we consider combined first and second NCE service population totals.  Vanguard would 
provide a first or second NCE service to 69,122 people (18,092 first service plus 51,030 second service); 
WRVM to 72,677 people (19,906 first service plus 52,771 second service).  Because neither proposal 
exceeds the other by at least 5,000 people, Vanguard and WRVM procced to the point system analysis.
103. Neither applicant claims points as an established local applicant or state-wide network.  
Vanguard and WRVM each claim two points for diversity of ownership.  With respect to technical 
parameters, Vanguard’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,324 square kilometers with a 
population of 163,678 people.  WRVM’s proposed 60 dBu contour would encompass 3,963 square 
kilometers with a population of 170,548 people.  Because neither applicant’s proposal would serve at 
least 10% more area and population than the other, we do not award points for this criterion.  
Accordingly, Vanguard and WRVM are each credited with two points and proceed to the tie-breaker 
analysis.
104. The first issue considered in a tie-breaker for NCE FM applicants is the number of radio 
station authorizations attributable to each applicant.  The applicant with the fewest authorizations 
prevails.  Vanguard certifies that it has no attributable interests, and WRVM certifies that it has 
attributable interests in 30 radio authorizations.  Vanguard is, therefore, the tentative selectee for Group 
223.89
IV. NEXT STEPS
105.Acceptability Studies and Filing of Petitions.  Once the Bureau or Commission 
identifies a tentative selectee pursuant to the fair distribution analysis or point system, the next step is to 
consider whether the selectee’s application has defects.90  The Commission has studied the application of 
each tentative selectee identified herein for application defects.  Each tentative selectee identified in this 
Order and its Appendix appears to be fully qualified to become the licensee of the new NCE FM station it 
has proposed.  We tentatively conclude that the grant of these applications would serve the public interest, 
convenience and necessity.  Accordingly, upon the release of this Order, the tentative selectees are 
accepted for filing.  This triggers a 30-day period for the filing of petitions to deny.91     
106. Any argument that the tentatively selected application should not be granted should be 
raised in such a petition, even if the objection relates only indirectly to the tentative selectee’s 
qualifications.  For example, an applicant that concedes that the tentative selectee is qualified for the 
points received but believes its own proposal should have received a greater number of points than the 
tentative selectee’s would make its argument in a petition to deny.  Likewise a disappointed applicant that 
believes the tentative selectee should have received fewer points would make such an argument in a 
petition to deny. Parties should not raise such matters as petitions for reconsideration of the instant Order 
89 On December 15, 2021, Call filed an Informal Objection to Vanguard’s application, and on January 11, 2022, 
WRVM filed a Petition to Deny the Vanguard application.  See Pleading Nos. 177311 and 179670.  We generally do 
not consider objections at this stage, but rather, review the merits of any objection if/when the subject application 
becomes accepted for filing.  We will review the merits of Call and WRVM’s pleadings after Vanguard’s 
application is accepted for filing.
90 If a tentative selectee’s application is found unacceptable for filing, it is dismissed.  The applicant then has one 
opportunity to submit a curative amendment and a petition for reconsideration requesting reinstatement nunc pro 
tunc within 30 days, provided that the amendment is minor and does not alter the fair distribution analysis.  See 47 
CFR § 73.3522(b)(1).  A tentative selectee that is unable to cure the defect is disqualified.  47 CFR § 73.7004(d).   
91 47 CFR § 73.7004.
813Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-5
because the point hearings herein take no final action on any application, and petitions for reconsideration 
do not lie against such interlocutory decisions.92
107.Forthcoming Staff Action.  We direct the Bureau staff, once the petition to deny period 
has run, to conduct a final study of each tentatively selected application in accordance with its routine 
processing procedures.  The staff studies should consider any petitions, comments, and objections to 
determine whether there is any substantial and material question of fact concerning whether grant of the 
tentatively selected application would serve the public interest.  If the Bureau finds on the basis of the 
application, the pleadings filed, or other matters which it may officially notice that there are no substantial 
and material questions of fact, and that a grant of the application would be consistent with the public 
interest, convenience, and necessity, it shall make the grant on the basis of the fair distribution analyses

substantial issues raised by the petition.93  
108. With the exception of issues that are novel or require Commission consideration as 
specified below, the staff shall act on the tentatively selected applications pursuant to delegated authority.  
We delegate to the staff authority to act on any routine matter that may be raised, including whether the 
applicant is eligible, as certified, for the points awarded herein, and whether the application complies with 
all relevant Commission rules and policies.94  The staff need not refer such matters to the full Commission 
unless the staff determines that the issues are new or novel, or raise a substantial and material question 
regarding the award of points.  Generally, the staff should refer issues to the Commission where the 
exclusion or inclusion of challenged or claimed points could alter the outcome in the particular NCE 
group, or where a new or novel question or substantial and material question of fact otherwise exists.95  In 
such cases, the staff would refer the mutually exclusive group to the Commission for resolution of the 
novel issue and/or the determination of a successor tentative selectee.

in the ordering clauses herein that each decision involving a mutually exclusive group is to be considered 
distinct and separate for purposes of petitions to deny, petitions for reconsideration, review on the 
Commission’s own motion, and appeals.  The timing of any action disposing of a petition or appeal affecting 
a particular group will not delay the finality of our decision for purposes of administrative or judicial review 
under section 1.103(b) of our rules with respect to any other group.96

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we continue the Commission’s efforts to improve the Rural Health Care 
(RHC) Program.  The RHC Program supports rural health care providers with the costs of broadband and 
other communications services so that they can serve patients in rural areas that may have limited 
resources, fewer doctors, and higher rates for broadband and communications services than urban areas.  
Telehealth and telemedicine services, which expanded considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
have also become essential tools for the delivery of health care to millions of rural Americans.  These 
services bridge the vast geographic distances that separate health care facilities, enabling patients to 
receive high-quality medical care without sometimes lengthy or burdensome travel.  The RHC Program 
promotes telehealth by providing financial support to eligible health care providers for broadband and 
telecommunications services.  
2. In today’s Order on Reconsideration, we address petitions for reconsideration of the 2019 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.1  We grant petitions challenging the database of urban and rural 
rates (Rates Database) for the Telecommunications Program (Telecom Program) established in the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, return the Telecom Program to the rate determination rules in 
place before the adoption of the Rates Database, and deny petitions for reconsideration of other issues 
from the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.  In the Report and Order, we adopt proposals from the 
February 2022 Further Notice to amend RHC Program invoicing processes and the internal cap 
application and prioritization rules to promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and 
prioritize support for the current funding year.2  In the Order, we dismiss as moot Applications for Review 
of the Commission’s guidance to the Universal Service Administrative Company (the Administrator) 
regarding the Rates Database.  Lastly, in the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we propose 
revisions to the rate determination rules, seek comment on to reinstating the cap on support for satellite 
services, propose to make it easier for health care providers to receive RHC Program funding as soon as 
they become eligible, propose to align the deadline to request a Service Provider Identification Number 
(SPIN) change with the invoice filling deadline, and seek comment on revisions to data collected in the 
Telecom Program. 
II. BACKGROUND
3. The RHC Program consists of two component programs: (1) the Telecom Program; and 
(2) the Healthcare Connect Fund (HCF) Program.  The Telecom Program was established in 1997 and

subsidizes the difference between the rates in the health care provider’s rural area and rates for 
comparable services available in urban areas within that state.3  The HCF Program was created in 2012 to 
promote the use of broadband services and facilitate the formation of health care provider consortia that 
include both rural and urban health care providers4 by providing a flat 65% discount on an array of 
advanced telecommunications and information services.5  
4. In August 2019, the Commission adopted the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 
which included several reforms to RHC Program rules and procedures with the goals of ensuring 
transparency and consistency in the Program and simplifying the calculation of urban and rural rates used 
to determine the amount of support available to health care providers under the Telecom Program.  
Specifically, the Commission directed the Administrator to create the Rates Database and determined that 
the urban and rural rates would be the median of all rates for functionally similar services6 in the relevant 
state within the health care provider’s applicable rural area.7  Other significant reforms included new rules 
for prioritizing RHC Program support for rural areas in the event Program demand exceeds available 
funding,8 reforms to ensure competitive bidding is fair and open,9 and adopting Program-wide rules and 
procedures to simplify application processes and provide clarity regarding procedures.10  Alaska 
Communications; the North Carolina Telehealth Network Association and Southern Ohio Health Care 
Network (collectively, NCTN/SOHCN); the Schools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition (SHLB); 
the State of Alaska Office of the Governor; and USTelecom – The Broadband Association (USTelecom) 
filed petitions for reconsideration seeking reconsideration of various aspects of the Promoting Telehealth 
Report and Order.11  GCI Communication Corp. (GCI) and Alaska Communications subsequently filed

paras. 1-3.
6 The Commission instructed the Administrator to determine whether services are functionally similar based on a 
“technology-agnostic inquiry” from the perspective of the end user experience and specifically noted that rates used 
to determine the median rate should include rates for private carriage and information services.  Promoting 
Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7345, para. 18.  Section 54.605 of the Commission’s rules directs 
applicants to use the lower of either the rural rate in the database or the rural rate included in a service agreement 
between the health care provider and the service provider.  47 CFR § 54.605(a). 
7 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7372-73, para. 78; 47 CFR §§ 54.604(a), 54.605(a).  
Under the Commission’s rules, the rurality tiers are defined as Less Rural, Rural, Extremely Rural, and Frontier.  
Less Rural areas are those that contain an urban area with a population of 25,000 or greater but are within a specific 
census tract that itself does not contain any part of a Place or Urban Area with a population of greater than 25,000.  
Rural areas are those that are within a Core Based Statistical Area that does not have an Urban Area with a 
population of 25,000 or greater.  Extremely Rural areas are those that are entirely outside of a Core Based Statistical 
Area.  Frontier areas are located in Alaska only, in areas outside of a Core Based Statistical Area that are 
inaccessible by road as determined by the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic 
Development, Division of Community and Regional Affairs.  See 47 CFR § 54.605(a)(1)(i)-(iv).

Applications for Review12 of a guidance letter the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) sent to the 
Administrator regarding implementation of the Rates Database.13   
5. Due to significant anomalies in the initial median urban and rural rate calculations in the 
Rates Database, the Bureau issued a series of waivers of the rules requiring use of the Rates Database 
through funding year 2023, initially for Alaska and subsequently for the entire United States.14  In lieu of 
the Rates Database, Program participants determined urban and rural rates using the rules that were in 
effect before the adoption of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.15  Participants also had the 
option to use a rate that had previously been approved under those rules.16  
6. In the Further Notice, we provided an overview of concerns about the Rates Database 
and sought comment on several issues related to determining support in the Telecom Program, including 
defining rurality, categorizing service technologies, various approaches to rate determination, and the 
potential transition period.17  We also sought comment on proposals to reform the RHC Program’s 
internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments, harmonize invoicing procedures, and 
sought general comment on additional steps to improve application processing, funding decisions, and 
appeals.18   
III. ORDER ON RECONSIDERATION
7. In this Order on Reconsideration, we restore the mechanisms for calculating rural and 
urban rates that existed before adoption of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.  We uphold the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order’s rule changes regarding what services are similar to one 
another.  We maintain the rurality tiers adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, which, 
due to the elimination of the Rates Database, now apply only to the prioritization of funding requests.  We 
also keep the internal cap and funding prioritization systems and invoice certifications requirements from 
the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.

A. Rates Determination
8. As an initial matter, we grant in part petitions seeking reconsideration of the rules the 
Commission adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order to implement the Rates Database and 
restore the three methods for calculating rural rates in the Telecom Program.  We deny petitions for 
reconsideration seeking review of clarifications and rules adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and 
Order regarding similar services and site and service substitution rules and dismiss as moot all remaining 
petitions related to the rules governing the Rates Database.  
1. Urban and Rural Rates Determination Mechanism
9. We grant in part petitions seeking reconsideration of the adoption of the Rates Database 
in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.  We amend the current sections 54.504 and 54.505 of the 
Commission’s rules to eliminate the use of the Rates Database to determine urban and rural rates and 
rescind the Commission’s direction to the Administrator in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order to 
create the Rates Database.19  Based on the record before us, we find that reinstating the Commission’s 
previous rules for calculating urban and rural rates, effective for RHC Program funding year 2024, is the 
best option for ensuring sufficient, reasonable rural and urban rates.20  
10. Section 254(h)(1)(A) of the Communications Act requires that Telecom Program support 
must be based on the difference between the urban rate, which must be “reasonably comparable to the 
rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State,” and “rates for similar services provided to 
other customers in comparable rural areas,” i.e., the rural rate.  Because the Rates Database was deficient 
in its ability to set adequate rates, we find that restoration of the previous rural rate determination rules, 
which health care providers have continued to use to determine rural rates in recent funding years under 
the applicable Rates Database waivers,21 is the best available option pending further examination in the 
Second Further Notice, to ensure that healthcare providers have adequate, predictable support.22 
11.Rural rates.  We first find that the rural rates generated by the Rates Database could 
result in inadequate or inconsistent Telecom Program support for rural health care providers that 
undermines the goals of the Telecom Program.  We agree with SHLB and the State of Alaska’s general 
arguments that the Rates Database would not accurately reflect the costs of delivering 
telecommunications services and would not provide sufficient funding for most rural health care 
providers because the Rates Database’s geographic rurality tiers were too broad and did not accurately 
represent the cost of serving dissimilar communities.23  The Commission created the rurality tiers to 
prevent median rates for more rural areas of a state from being unfairly reduced due to the inclusion of 
rates for similar services in less rural areas.24  This approach to rate determination was based on “the 
reasonable assumption that the cost to provide telecommunications services increases as the density of an 
19 See 47 CFR §§ 54.504, 50.505; Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7372-73, paras. 76-78.
20 Until 2019, these rules had been codified in section 54.607.  Because that section number has since been re-
assigned, the new rules for determining rural rates will replace the current section 54.605.
21 See Alaska Rates Database Waiver Order; Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order; Alaska Rates Database 
Waiver Extension; Nationwide Rates Database Extension Order.
22 The Bureau permitted the use of previously-approved rural rates in the waivers of the Rates Database.  Nationwide 
Rates Database Waiver Order, at 7-8, para. 17.  Because the rules we are restoring today did not allow for the use of 
previously-approved rural rates, this option will not be available to RHC Program participants.  
23 SHLB Petition at 13-14; State of Alaska Petition at 4-5.  Commenters responding to the Further Notice also 
argued that the Rates Database provided inadequate support for health care providers.  See SHLB Comments at 5; 
SHLB Reply Comments at 7-8; Windstream Comments at 5-7; Alaska Communications Comments at 27; ANHB 
Comments at 7; GCI Comments at 5.  We address arguments made in petitions for reconsideration that the Rates 
Database provided inadequate support and therefore do not address these comments.  
24 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7351, para. 33.
831Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
area decreases, as rates are generally a function of population density.”25  However, we find that in light 
of the significant anomalies in the Rates Database uncovered by the Bureau, including many situations 
where support amounts for more rural areas were less than those for less rural areas,26 the petitioners are 
correct that the geographic tiers used in the Rates Database do not result in rates that accurately reflect the 
cost of delivering telecommunications services for many rural health care providers.27
12.  Under the rules we reinstate today, healthcare providers may use one of three methods 
for calculating the rural rates in the Telecom Program, depending on the circumstances: (1) the average of 
rates that the carrier actually charges to other non-health care provider commercial customers for the 
same or similar services provided in the rural area where the health care provider is located (Method 1); 
(2) if the carrier does not have any commercial customers in the health care provider’s rural area, the 
average of tariffed and other publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same or 
similar services provided over the same distance in the rural health care provider’s area (Method 2); or (3) 
if there are no such rates or the carrier reasonably determines that those rates would be unfair, a cost-
based rate that is approved by the Commission for interstate services (or the relevant state commission for 
intrastate services) (Method 3).28  A carrier seeking approval of a rural rate under Method 3 will be 
required to provide “a justification of the proposed rural rate that includes an itemization of the costs of 
providing the requested service.”29
13. We reiterate the requirements previously associated with this methodology.  Methods 1, 
2, and 3 must be applied sequentially.  Method 1 must be used to determine a rural rate unless the service 
provider selected is not actually charging non-health care provider customers rates for same or similar 
services in the rural area where the eligible health care provider is located.30  In that case, health care 
providers and service providers must attempt to calculate a rural rate using Method 2.31  If it is not 
possible to determine a rural rate because there are no tariffed or publicly available32 rates charged by 
other service providers for same or similar services in the rural area where the eligible health care 
provider is located, or if the service provider reasonably determines that the rural rate calculated using

Proposed Rulemaking, 26 FCC Rcd 17663, 17717 n.220 (2011) (noting that the same characteristics, such as lack of 
density, that make it expensive to provide voice service make it expensive to provide broadband service as well); 
Federal Communications Commission, Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan, at 136 (2010)

deploying and operating broadband networks, including expected returns on capital, there is no business case to 
offer broadband services in these areas”).

exceeds available funding).

31 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.605(b), as adopted herein; see also 47 CFR § 54.607(b) (2019).
32 Available rates include tariff rates and rates posted on service providers’ websites, rate cards, and publicly 
available contracts such as state master contracts, as well as undiscounted rates charged to E-Rate Program 
applicants, and prior funding year RHC Program pricing data.  This list of possible sources of available rates is not 
intended to be exhaustive and other sources may be possible.  The Wireline Competition Bureau Provides Guidance 
Regarding the Commission’s Rules for Determining Rural Rates in the Rural Health Care Telecommunications 
Program, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 533, 537 (WCB 2019) (Rural Rates Public Notice).  
832Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
Method 2 is unfair, then health care providers and service providers may calculate a rural rate using 
Method 3.33  
14. Reinstating these rules promotes administrative efficiency and protects the Fund while 
we consider long-term solutions.  We clarify that a rural rate approval for a service will be required only 
in the first year of an evergreen contract or another form of a multi-year contract unless the rural rates in 
the contract increase or other substantive terms of the contract change.34  The rural rate approval for the 
initial year of the multi-year contract will constitute approval for all subsequent years of the contract, 
including voluntary extensions so long as the duration of the contract does not exceed five years.  Given 
that service providers may not be expected to submit additional bids for the selected service within the 
duration of the multi-year contract, we believe that it is reasonable to eliminate  rural rate approvals 
during that period as well.  Therefore, previously approved rates for preexisting multi-year contracts do 
not need to be resubmitted for approval under the rate setting mechanisms we reinstate today.
15. We decline to adopt other options proposed by stakeholders or the Commission because 
they could lead to Program waste or pose implementation challenges.  Alaska Communications and 
SHLB’s suggestion to rely on competitive bidding alone to determine fair market rural rates could result 
in inflated rural rates.35  As the Commission previously explained in the Promoting Telehealth Report and 
Order, only a small percentage of Telecom Program funding requests receive competing bids from 
multiple service providers, and in the few instances where carriers do compete, they are most likely to 
compete on non-price characteristics of service.36  Therefore, we find that relying on competitive bidding 
without any other checks on rural rates would give service providers unfettered discretion to set their 
rates.  Additionally, we find that the implementation challenges associated with the options raised in the 
Further Notice, such as a regression model37 or a discount tier mechanism prevent us at this time from 
adopting these mechanisms.  
16.Rural rates waiver.  We find that Bureau’s temporary measure of permitting the use of 
previously-approved rural rates and urban rates for funding year 2023 is appropriate given that 
competitive bidding for funding year 2023 has already started.38  To further alleviate burdens on RHC 
Program participants as they prepare for funding years 2024 and 2025 we waive the Commission’s rules 
33 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.605(b), as adopted herein; see also 47 CFR § 54.607(b) (2019).

The Bureau also granted wavier to permit the use of rural and urban rates for funding years 2021 and 2022.  See 
Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order; Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order.  
833Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
to permit the use of previously-approved rates for any funding year 2024 or 2025 rural rates that would 
otherwise require approval under Method 3.39  
17. Generally, the Commission’s rules may be waived or suspended for good cause shown.40  
The Commission may exercise its discretion to waive a rule where the particular facts make strict 
compliance inconsistent with the public interest.41  In addition, the Commission may take into account 
considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation of overall policy on an individual 
basis.42  Waiver of the Commission’s rules is appropriate only if both (1) special circumstances warrant a 
deviation from the general rule, and (2) such deviation will serve the public interest.43  As noted by 
several commenters,44 potentially having three different sets of rules for determining cost-based rural rates 
within three or four funding years could present unnecessary administrative burdens.  Continuing to 
permit the use of previously-approved rural rates for Method 3, the most complex rural rates verification 
process, would significantly curtail those burdens.45  Furthermore, according to commenters, market 
conditions appear to indicate that it is unlikely that pricing for Telecom Program funded services will 
significantly decrease over funding years 2024 or 2025, so utilizing rural rates approved for funding year 
2023 in funding years 2024 and 2025 is unlikely to cause wasteful expenditures.46  
18. A waiver permitting the use of previously-approved rates for funding years 2024 and 
2025 Method 3 cost-based rural rates would also serve the public interest.  Although there are significant 
program integrity benefits to rural rates reviews, we find that two years of such benefits is outweighed for 
funding years 2024 and 2025 by the administrative burdens on both program applicants and the 
Commission to prepare and approve cost studies.  In addition, we find that it is not in the public interest to 
require service providers to absorb these burdens for funding years 2024 and 2025 given that the 
Commission is considering additional changes to its rural rate rules for future funding years in today’s 
Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.47  
19. In addition, we find that the public interest would not be served by extending this waiver 
to Method 1 and 2 rural rate or urban rate approvals because the administrative burden and time required 
for these justifications are considerably less than for Method 3 justifications.48  Therefore we find that for 
Method 1 and 2 and urban rate justifications, the program integrity benefits to requiring rate justifications 
outweigh any administrative burdens associated with complying with these rules for funding years 2024 
39 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.605(b), as adopted herein.  Should the Commission adopt new rules 
for determining rural rates in advance of funding year 2024 or 2025, the Commission reserves the right to have those 
rules supersede this waiver.

and 2025.  Furthermore, we find that a waiver under Methods 1 or 2 is not necessary because, when a 
service provider cannot find justifying rates under Methods 1 or 2, as some parties contend is common,49 
the service provider has the option to rely on a previously approved Method 3 rate pursuant to the waiver 
we issue herein.
20. When this Method 3 waiver applies, a service provider may use a previously-approved 
rural rate from the most recent funding commitment for the facility/service combination at issue provided 
that funding commitment was issued in funding years 2021, 2022, or 2023.   If there is no approved rate 
for a particular facility/service combination, the health care provider and its carrier may use a rural rate 
for the most recent funding commitment for the same or similar services to the facility with the same or 
similar geographic characteristics provided the funding commitment was issued in funding years 2021, 
2022, or 2023.  If no such comparable rates are available, this waiver is not applicable and the rural rate 
must be established using a Method 3 cost study pursuant to section 54.605(b) of our rules.50    
21. For the reasons stated above, we find that restoring the previous rate methodology rules 
while we consider long-term solutions would best serve Program participants.  Program participants are 
already familiar with the requirements of these methods, which will ease administrative burdens on the 
Commission, Administrator, and Program participants.   
22. Although the rules that we reinstate today do not rely on a median approach to determine 
rural rates, as a general matter, we disagree with petitioners’ concerns with using a median-based 
approach to determine rural rates.  The Rates Database’s use of medians was a reasonable application of 
section 254(h)(1)(A) to prevent outlier prices from skewing support.51  Alaska Communications argued 
that, by basing support on a median rate rather than the actual rate charged, the Rates Database would not 
fulfill the requirements of section 254(h)(1)(A) of the Communications Act that telecommunications 
carriers receive the difference between the urban rate paid by the healthcare provider and the rate “similar 
services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas.”52  Similarly, USTelecom raised several 
concerns about the sufficiency of the median rate approach.53  Although we agree with petitioners that the 
Rates Database and geographic tiers established in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order did not 
accurately reflect the cost of delivering telecommunications services, we find that a median approach to 
calculate rural rates can satisfy the requirements of section 254(h)(1)(A) because a median can 
approximate the rates charged in “comparable rural areas in the state.”54  The fact that section 
254(h)(1)(A) describes the services provider’s obligation to charge “rates” reasonably comparable to 
urban rates rather than a more restrictive standard such as “the rate charged to an urban health care 
provider” suggests the Commission could meet the requirements of section 254(h)(1)(A) as long as the 
level of support in the aggregate would make up the urban-rural differential.  
23.Urban rates.  We also grant petitions seeking rescission of the rules implementing the 
Rates Database to determine urban rates.  Petitioners seeking reconsideration of the Promoting Telehealth

Report and Order raised concerns about the Administrator’s ability to determine urban rates using the 
Rates Database.55  Furthermore, after the Rates Database launched, specific concerns about the urban rates 
it generated arose.56  In the Nationwide Rates Database Waiver Order, the Bureau acknowledged urban 
rate anomalies in the Rates Database in some states, including instances where urban rates for lower 
bandwidths exceeded urban rates for higher bandwidths for the same service, and examples of urban rates 
exceeding rural rates in a state.57  The Bureau concluded that these examples did not amount to 
convincing evidence of “pervasive nationwide anomalies with urban rates” but did “merit further inquiry 
and investigation” and therefore waived use of the Rates Database of determining urban rates.58  In 
comments in response to the Further Notice, SHLB reiterated that the Rates Database had significant 
urban rate anomalies, including instances in many states in which the median urban rate for a service 
exceeded at least one rural rate.59  ADS encouraged the Commission to reinstate a “safe harbor” approach 
for urban rates.60 
24. We conclude that reinstating the previous urban rate determination rules is the best way 
to ensure consistency and predictability in the rate determination process while we consider alternative 
options for an urban rates determination mechanism going forward.61  None of the petitions for 
reconsideration suggested a mechanism for determining urban rates to be used if we were to eliminate the 
Rates Database, and none opposed returning to the pre-Promoting Telehealth Report and Order method 
for determining urban rates.  As with rural rates, health care providers and service providers are already 
familiar with the pre-2019 rules for determining urban rates, and introducing a completely new set of 
rules while we consider additional changes could lead to confusion and cause an undue administrative 
burden.  Therefore, going forward, the urban rate for an eligible service submitted by the healthcare 
provider on FCC Form 466 should be “no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate 
charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city with a population of 
50,000 or more in [a] state.”62  Healthcare providers must document the urban rate with “tariff pages, 
contracts, a letter on company letterhead from the urban service provider, rate pricing information printed 
from the urban service provider’s website or similar documentation showing how the urban rate was 
obtained.”63  We believe reinstatement of the prior urban rate setting methodology is the best available 
solution as we seek comment on potential revisions to the urban rate determination rules in the Second

to its website examples of urban rates for certain services in various states that health care providers could use 
instead of obtaining urban rates through other means.   
61 Until 2019, these rules had been codified in section 54.605.  The current section 54.604, which governs 
determinations of urban rates using the Rates Database, will be amended to reflect the new rules.

Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking herein.  As with rural rates, we also affirm the Bureau’s decision 
to permit the use of previously-approved urban rates for funding year 2023.64
25. In adopting the Rates Database, the Commission identified several concerns with the 
rate-setting rules in place at the time, including potential issues with transparency, administrative 
efficiency, and program integrity.65  While the Rates Database proved to be an inadequate solution for 
provisioning sufficient support to RHC Program participants, we remain cognizant of those concerns, and 
we therefore continue our work to improve the Telecom Program rate determination methodology as 
discussed in the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking herein.
2. Similar Services
26. Though RHC Program applicants and participating service providers will no longer use 
the Rates Database to calculate rural and urban rates, they will continue to need to identify rates for the 
same or similar services to support rural and urban rates submitted to the Administrator.  We therefore 
address petitions for reconsideration of the Commission’s conclusions regarding similar services in the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.66  We find that the Commission properly determined that similar 
services can include non-telecommunications services that deliver the same or similar functionality as the 
requested service and can include services with advertised speeds 30% above or below the speed of the 
requested service.  We instruct the Administrator to apply these requirements to its review of Method 1 
and Method 2 submissions and urban rates going forward. 
27.Non-telecommunications services.  We affirm the Commission’s finding that, to calculate 
the most accurate rates, the pool of rates taken into consideration should include rates for services that 
deliver the functionality sought by the applicant.  We therefore deny USTelecom’s request to reverse the 
decision that non-telecommunications services that are functionally similar to eligible 
telecommunications services be considered similar services for purposes of calculating rates.67  We 
reaffirm the Commission’s conclusion in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that similarity of 
services is a “technology-agnostic inquiry” that should be viewed from the perspective of the end user 
experience as opposed to regulatory classification.68  
28. The Telecom Program provides support in accordance with section 254(h)(1)(A) of the 
Communications Act based on the difference between the urban rate, which must be “reasonably 
comparable to the rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State,” and “rates for similar 
services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas,” i.e., the rural rate.69  Congress did not 
define the term “similar services.”70  In 2003, the Commission interpreted similar services to mean 
services that are functionally similar from the perspective of the end user.71  This interpretation deviated

from the Commission’s previous policy of calculating support based on the difference between the urban 
and rural rates for “technically” similar services.72  Without any discussion as to why non-
telecommunications services were not considered “functionally similar,” the Commission stated that 
“[e]ligible health care providers must purchase telecommunications services and compare their service to 
a functionally equivalent telecommunications service in order to receive this discount” and created a 
voluntary “safe harbor” for categories of services based on transmission speed that would be considered 
by the Commission functionally similar for purposes of calculating urban and rural rates.73  
29. In the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Commission sought comment on 
changes to the interpretation of similar services.74  The Commission specifically proposed to “retain the 
concept of ‘functionally similar as viewed from the perspective of the end user’” and additionally 
proposed to “require healthcare providers to analyze similarity under specific criteria.”75  In the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission ultimately retained the “functionally similar” 
standard for defining similar services and, after acknowledging the prior interpretation in 2003, made 
clear that because the functionally similar standard is technology agnostic and does not turn on regulatory 
classification, both telecommunications and non-telecommunications services must be considered when 
identifying similar services for calculating urban and rural rates.76
30. USTelecom argues that the Commission did not provide an opportunity for notice and 
comment, as required by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), before expanding the inquiry of 
functionally similar services to include non-telecommunications services.77  On the contrary, the 
Commission did provide notice in the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of its intent to consider 
changes to the statutory interpretation of similar services.78  And as explained in the Promoting Telehealth 
Report and Order, revisiting this decision would inevitably involve a consideration of the types of 
services that would fall within the scope of this statutory term.79  We therefore disagree with USTelecom 
(Continued from previous page)  
Access Order) (discussing “Interpretation of ‘Similar Services’”).  The Commission revised its rules on the 
determination of urban and rural rates consistent with this interpretation in 2003 to reference functionally similar 
services instead of similar services.  Id. at 24586-89 (revising rule sections 54.605 and 54.609).

experience.”); id. at 10656, para. 77 (“We seek comment on other criteria we could use to establish ‘similar 
services.’”).
79 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7343, para. 18, n.55.  The Commission also 
specifically sought comment on using performance criteria associated with packet-based services that are often 
provided on a non-common carrier basis in the marketplace, e.g., as private carrier or information services.  See 
2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 32 FCC Rcd at 10656, para. 77.  This would provide an additional indication 
to the public that the Commission was considering a functionally similar standard that would not turn on the 
regulatory classification of the service.  
838Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
that the Commission violated the APA when it clarified the scope of similar services to include not only 
telecommunications but also non-telecommunications services.80 
31. The Commission’s decision to expand the inquiry of functionally similar services in 
urban and rural rate determinations was not arbitrary and capricious, as USTelecom separately contends.81  
We also disagree with USTelecom that the fact that the Telecom Program does not fund information and 
private carriage services precludes consideration of rates for those services in the rate determination 
process.82  As to both arguments, the Commission fully considered these issues in the Promoting 
Telehealth Report and Order and explained that the end-user experience, not regulatory classification, 
guides our analysis of whether services are functionally equivalent.83  The Commission further explained 
that including information services, which may be less expensive, with functionally similar 
telecommunications services is consistent with the statutory requirement that the Commission ensure 
access to telecommunications services for health care providers at rates that are “reasonably comparable” 
to those charged for “similar services in urban areas” because including rates for such functionally similar 
information services would more accurately reflect the prices available in urban areas for services that 
deliver the same functionality to end users regardless of classification, and place rural health care 
providers on equal footing with their urban counterparts.84  
32.30 percent threshold.  We also deny SHLB’s request that we reconsider the 
Commission’s determination that services with advertised speeds 30% above or below the speed of the 
requested service be considered functionally similar to the requested service.85  SHLB argues that this 
approach is overbroad and will include services that are dissimilar in function and cost.  SHLB, however, 
does not offer any examples.86  Comments filed after the Rates Database launched addressing the 30% 
threshold in response to the Further Notice were mixed.  Alaska Communications described the 30% 
bandwidth range as “not unreasonable,” but cautioned that there is too little rural rate data in Alaska to 
“make this the basis for a complete rural rate methodology.”87  NTCA argues that the 30% threshold is 
too broad and urges the Commission to implement a smaller margin based on health care provider use 
cases, but also does not offer examples of overly broad results.88  
80 Assuming, arguendo, that there was insufficient notice and comment, the Commission’s defining of similar 
services and functionally similar services as referenced in the Commission’s rules, to include telecommunications 
and non-telecommunications services that are functionally similar from the perspective of the end user could have 
been adopted as an interpretation not subject to the APA’s notice-and-comment requirements.  See 5 U.S.C. § 
553(b)(A) (stating that the notice-and-comment requirement do not apply to “interpretative rules, general statements 
of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.”); Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 97 
(2015) (“[T]he critical feature of interpretive rules is that they are “issued by an agency to advise the public of the 
agency’s construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.”).  The Commission’s rules use the term 
“functionally similar” so the clarification made in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order could be viewed as a 
revised interpretation of the Commission’s rules to include non-telecommunications services.  47 CFR §§ 54.604(a),

33. Taking these arguments into account, we conclude that we should not deviate from the 
Commission’s prior conclusion in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that the 30% range allows 
for rate predictability while accounting for the rising demand for faster connectivity.89  Having a standard 
for determining similar services based on a range is preferable to having speed tiers, which would need to 
be frequently refreshed so they would not become out of date, as was the case with the speed tiers that 
existed before the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.  Moreover, based on the record previously 
developed, a range of 30% provides a sufficiently large number of inputs for determining rates under 
Methods 1 and 2.90  Reducing the range as NTCA requests would likely mean that few services with even 
slight variations in bandwidth would be similar to one another.91  Additionally, maintaining the current 
threshold for similar services of advertised speeds being 30% above or below the speed of the requested 
service will ease program administration because health care providers are already familiar with this 
standard. 
34. We also disagree with SHLB’s assertion that the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order 
fails to account for price variations based on contract term or volume discounts, which SHLB maintains 
will distort rural rate determinations.92  The Promoting Telehealth Report and Order did account for these 
price variations when explaining that section 254(h)(1)(A) requires service providers to provide 
telecommunications services to eligible providers at “rates that are reasonably comparable to rates 
charged for similar services in urban areas.”93 
35. Finally, as requested by GCI, we clarify that, in the event there is no comparable rural 
rate within 30% of the speed of the requested service, the Commission will allow service providers to 
justify the requested rural rate using the rate for a service that is otherwise similar to the requested service 
if the requested service has a higher bandwidth than that service.94  Similarly, as requested by SHLB,95 we 
clarify that if there is no comparable urban rate within the 30% range available, the Commission will 
allow service providers to use the rate for a higher bandwidth service that falls outside the 30% range but 
is otherwise similar to the requested service.96  We find that providing this flexibility will ease 
administrative burdens without additional cost to the Universal Service Fund. 
3. Site and Service Substitution
36. We deny Alaska Communications’ petition for reconsideration to the extent it seeks 
clarification that “the Commission intended to include service delivery dates” in the adopted site and 
89 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7343-44, para. 16.  SHLB also asserts that determining 
rates on a per-Mbps basis could be used within the 30% advertising speed range.  SHLB Petition at 16.  The 
Commission rejected the per-Mbps approach in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order as contrary to the 
purpose of the similar services inquiry, which is to identify services that are functionally similar to the end user and 
not to identify services that are similarly priced.  Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7366,

claiming that section 254(h)(1)(A) only “describes the urban rate” and not the determination of permissible rural 
rates.  See SHLB Petition at 17.  The very purpose of section 254(h)(1)(A) is to establish the means of determining 
rural rates by comparison to urban rates (i.e., “[rural] rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for 
similar services in urban areas in the State.”).  47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(A).

service substitution rule.97  Alaska Communications explains that service date or evergreen contract date 
changes are some of the most common changes requested in the RHC Program.98  Alaska 
Communications further explains that applicants are required to submit a funding request and include 
anticipated service dates at the time the request is submitted to the Administrator, but there may be delays 
for a planned transition or deployment of upgraded services and the anticipated service start or 
termination dates may change.99  In response, we clarify that under section 54.624(a) of our rules, RHC 
Program applicants may be able to substitute the requested service when there is a delay in the 
deployment of the original service and that the funding request could be modified to reflect the substituted 
service when such a delay may occur.100  Section 54.624(a) is intended to allow applicants flexibility to 
substitute requested services and to receive RHC Program support for substituted services when the 
requirements are met.101
37. However, we deny Alaska Communications’ request to clarify that section 54.624(a) 
allows changes to service dates and evergreen contract dates as “service substitution” changes because 
section 54.624(a) does not address service dates or evergreen contract dates.102  With respect to service 
date changes, Program participants are already permitted to change the dates for which services are 
provided.  RHC Program participants are required to provide dates of service and contract dates on the 
Request for Funding (FCC Form 466 or FCC Form 462) for the requested services.103  If there are changes 
to the dates for which services were provided or evergreen contract dates, RHC Program participants 
already modify service dates through other means unrelated to the service substitution process.104  
Therefore, there is already a mechanism for all RHC Program participants to substitute a service if there is

due to the potential for an appeal, this process is no more administratively burdensome than the service 
substitution request process.  Under both processes, if the Administrator denies a request, the health care 
provider could file an appeal.105  With respect to evergreen contract dates, although section 54.624 cannot 
reasonably be interpreted as addressing modifications to evergreen contract dates, we seek comment in 
the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking below about whether a mechanism to modify 
evergreen contract dates is appropriate and what such a mechanism might be.106  Accordingly, we deny 
the request to modify section 54.624 to add modification of service dates and evergreen contract dates as 
an allowable service substitution.  
38. Alaska Communications further requests that when the Administrator contacts a health 
care provider with questions or requests for additional information regarding urban or rural rates or the 
terms of the service, the Administrator also be required to communicate the question or information 
request with the relevant service provider.107  Health care providers are encouraged to work with their 
service providers to respond to information requests from the Administrator regarding, for example, 
additional information on urban and rural rates and terms of service.108  Thus, service providers are 
allowed to provide the requested information needed during the funding application review process.109 We 
decline, however, to require the Administrator to issue information requests to the relevant service 
providers.  We conclude that it would be administratively burdensome and a poor use of limited 
administrative resources to require the Administrator to send these requests to service providers.  
Applicants that would like assistance from service providers should reach out to providers to pose 
questions related to the Administrator’s review of health care providers’ funding applications.110  
4. Remaining Requests for Reconsideration of the Rates Database
39. We dismiss as moot all other challenges to the Rates Database raised in the petitions for 
reconsideration that are not applicable to rural rate determinations under Method 1, Method 2, or Method 
3 or urban rate determinations.111  Our decision above to eliminate the use of the Rates Database to 
calculate urban and rural rates renders these challenges moot.112

B. Rurality
40. We next deny requests to reconsider aspects of the geographically-based rurality tiers 
adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.113  Though the termination of the Rates Database 
moots the use of rurality tiers for purposes of rates determination, rurality tiers are also used to prioritize 
support in the event that demand exceeds available support, a mechanism that is unchanged by today’s 
actions.114    
41. In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission established three tiers of 
rurality to determine comparable rural areas in a state or territory for purposes of the Rates Database: (1) 
Extremely Rural (areas entirely outside of a Core Based Statistical Area); (2) Rural (areas within a Core 
Based Statistical Area that does not have an Urban Area with a population of 25,000 or greater); and (3) 
Less Rural (areas in a Core Based Statistical Area that contains an Urban Area with a population of 
25,000 or greater, but are within a specific census tract that itself does not contain any part of a Place or 
Urban Area with a population of greater than 25,000).115  For health care providers in Alaska, the 
Commission bifurcated the Extremely Rural tier to include a Frontier tier for areas not accessible by 
road.116
42. Arguments against the rurality tiers adopted by the Commission in the Promoting 
Telehealth Report and Order focused on their impact on rates determinations in the Rates Database.117  
With the elimination of the Rates Database, the only remaining relevance of rurality tiers is for purposes 
of prioritizing support in the event that demand ever exceeds available funding.118  We find that the 
rurality tiers as adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order are appropriate for purposes of 
prioritization of support and deny petitions for reconsideration to the extent they request that the 
Commission eliminate rurality tiers from its rules for all purposes.  The rurality tiers will properly target 
RHC Program funding to less populous areas in the event that prioritization of funds is needed, and the 
(Continued from previous page)  
112 Additionally, we dismiss the petition for reconsideration filed by USTelecom to the extent it seeks modification 
of the FCC Form 465 or clarification of its instructions.  See USTelecom Petition at 23-25.  These requests are 
outside the scope of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.  See 47 CFR § 1.429(l)(5) (allowing dismissal of 
petitions for reconsideration that relate to matters outside the scope of the order for which reconsideration is sought).  
Furthermore, the FCC Forms 461 and 465 already capture the range of bandwidths the health care provider seeks 
bids for.  See Request for Services Form, FCC Form 461, OMB Control No. 3060-0604; Description of Services 
Requested and Certification Form, FCC Form 465, OMB Control No. 3060-0604.   
113 See State of Alaska Petition at 4-7; NCTNA/SOHCN Petition at 10-13; SHLB Petition at 12-15.  
114 See 47 CFR § 54.621(b).   
115 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7346-47, para. 21. 
116 Id. at 7352, para. 34.  The Commission defined Frontier areas as those that are outside of a Core Based Statistical 
Area that are inaccessible by road.  To determine which communities are connected by roads, the Commission stated 
that it would use data provided by the Alaska Department of Commerce Community and Economic Development, 
Division of Community and Regional Affairs. Id. at 7352-53, para. 35.
117 See SHLB Petition at 13-14 (contending that the tiers are overly broad because they group together areas of states 
with differing topography and infrastructure and are therefore not tied to the actual cost of service); State of Alaska 
Petition at 4-6 (arguing that Alaska should be differentiated geographically based on fiber availability); 
NCTNA/SOHCN Petition at 10-13 (requesting that the Commission use United States Census Bureau designation 
that divides Core-Based Statistical Areas into Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, 
arguing that relying on Census-recognized designations would allow applicants and the Administrator to pre-qualify 
sites and determine funding priority for each site).  
118 See 47 CFR § 54.621(b) (setting tiers for prioritization based on rurality tiers and designation as a Medically 
Underserved Area or Population).  
843Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
record contains no alternative mechanism for better parsing rurality for this limited purpose.119    
43. NCTNA/SOHCN suggests that switching to a method based on metropolitan and 
micropolitan designations would “allow [the Administrator] to pre-qualify sites and to demonstrate 
rurality and to determine the funding priority each site will receive” and that switching from designations 
based on census blocks instead of census tracts would be more precise.  However, the Administrator has 
already created a tool that allows health care providers to determine their priority tier based on the current 
rurality designations, so a change is not necessary to provide this administrative convenience.120  While 
we recognize the benefit of precision in parsing rurality, we find that the potential confusion and 
administrative burdens to all Program participants that would result from abandoning the use of the 
current rurality tiers, which are consistent with the Commission’s long-held definition of “rural,” 
outweighs the impact this change would have on the limited number of health care providers whose rural 
status would change.121 
44. Given our decision on reconsideration to eliminate the rules establishing the Rates 
Database, we make two ministerial changes to our rules to reflect the limited use of rurality tiers for 
prioritization purposes.122  First, we eliminate the concept of Frontier Areas from our rules because it does 
not apply to prioritizing support.  A “Frontier Area” is an area in Alaska outside of a Core Based 
Statistical Area that is inaccessible by road.  The Commission adopted this concept for purposes of the 
Rates Database only.123  Second, we amend our codified rules so that rurality tiers are addressed only in 
rules related to prioritization.  The rurality tiers currently appear in two separate sections of our rules: 
section 54.605(a), which addresses rural rates, and section 54.621(b), which addresses prioritization of 
support.  We delete references to the rurality tiers from section 54.605(a) but retain them in section 
54.621(b).  We also make minor changes to the text of section 54.621(b) so that it more closely reflects 
the text of section 54.605(a).124      
C. Funding Prioritization
1. Internal Cap on Multi-Year Commitments and Upfront Payments  
45. We deny NCTNA/SOHCN’s petition for reconsideration requesting an increase to the 
internal cap on funding available to HCF applicants seeking support for upfront payments and multi-year 
commitments.125  This internal cap limits funding for multi-year commitments and upfront payment to an 
119 Because there has been sufficient funding to satisfy demand since the prioritization rules adopted in the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the prioritization system has never been used.  
120 See USAC website, Rurality Tier Search Tool, https://www.usac.org/rural-health-care/resources/tools/rurality-
tier-search-tool/ ( last visited Jan. 26, 2023).  
121 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7350, para. 32.
122 We find additional notice and comment for these changes is not needed because it would be unnecessary given 
that they are ministerial reflections of other changes to the rules.  See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B); see also 47 CFR § 
1.412(c).  
123 Compare 47 CFR §54.605(a)(1)(iv) to 47 CFR §54.621(b).  For purposes of prioritization, Frontier Areas were 
treated as part of the Extremely Rural Tier.  
124 Section 54.605(a) defined the Extremely Rural Tier as “areas” entirely outside of a Core Based Statistical Area 
whereas section 54.621(a) defined it as “counties” entirely outside of Core Based Statistical Area.  We apply the 
nomenclature that appeared in section 54.605(a) to section 54.621(a).     
125 NCTNA/SOHCN Petition at 7.  NCTNA/SOHCN also urge the Commission to “revisit” the overall annual cap 
under the RHC Program.  See id. at 3-6; see also 47 CFR § 54.619(a) (setting the funding cap at $571 million per 
funding year and adjusting that figure annually for inflation beginning in funding year 2018).  We decline to do so 
here as the time for reconsideration of our decision to increase the cap on overall funding, which was adopted in 
2018, has passed.  See Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, WC Docket No. 17-310, Report and Order, 33 FCC 
Rcd 6574 (2018) (RHC Program Cap Order).    
844Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
amount adjusted annually for inflation, which is calculated at $161 million for funding year 2022.126  The 
Commission retained the internal cap in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order after determining 
that the cap protected against possible underfunding of single-year funding requests and that an increase 
in the dollar amount of the internal cap may adversely affect single-year requests.127  The Commission 
did, however, adopt a rule adjusting the cap annually for inflation as a hedge against loss of purchasing 
power in the event of price inflation.128  NCTNA/SOHCN maintain that the decision to not further 
increase the internal cap is “based on an incorrect reading of the purpose of [the] cap” – namely, that the 
principal purpose of establishing the cap was to guard against fluctuations in demands from potentially 
large upfront infrastructure projects.129  NCTNA/SOHCN also argue that the Commission should 
reconsider the cap “in light of its original purpose and data accumulated since 2013 when it was first 
implemented”130 and therefore should remove multi-year funding commitments from being subject to the 
cap.131  
46. We deny NCTNA/SOHCN’s request.132  The internal cap on multi-year commitments and 
upfront payments in its current form is serving its stated purpose: to limit major fluctuations in demand so 
as to protect single-year funding requests.  In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the 
Commission noted that the internal cap was first exceeded in funding year 2018 and, but for the cap, all 
funding requests for that year would have been prorated to bring the total demand for RHC Program 
support below the Program’s overall funding cap.133  We also find that the record does not support 
removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap.  NCTNA/SOHCN point to efficiencies that are 
inherent to some multi-year funding commitments.134  However, USAC data indicates that demand for 
multi-year commitments accounted for a significant portion of the total demand for multi-year 
126 See 47 CFR § 54.619(a) (establishing an internal cap of $150 million for funding requests for upfront payment 
and multi-year commitments); 47 CFR § 54.619(a)(2) (requiring the internal cap to be adjusted annually for 
inflation).  See also Wireline Competitive Bureau Announces E-Rate and RHC Programs’ Inflation-Based Caps for 
Funding Year 2022, CC Docket No. 02-6, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, DA 22-271 (WCB Mar. 14, 2022) 
(announcing an internal cap of $161 million for funding year 2022).  
127 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7401, para. 138.
128 See id. at para. 139.  To measure increases in the rate of inflation for purposes of adjusting the internal cap on 
multi-year commitments and upfront payments, the Commission uses the Gross Domestic Product Chain-type Price 
Index (GDP-CPI).  See 47 CFR § 54.619(a)(2).

130 Id. at 9.
131 Id. at 8.
132 While we deny NCTNA/SOHCN’s request to increase the internal cap, the internal cap application rule we adopt 
today in the Report and Order below reduces the chance that the internal cap will create a cut in funding for multi-
year commitment and upfront payment requests, because as long as the total available funding is greater than the 
total demand, the internal cap will not apply.  See infra Part IV.B; Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.619(a), as 
adopted herein.
133 Since then, program demand for multi-year commitments and upfront payments has exceeded the internal cap in 
funding year 2019 and 2020, though full funding of single-year requests was not inhibited.  See Rural Health Care 
Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 2659, 2662, para. 8 (2020) (Funding Year 2019 
Demand Order) (funding year 2019 funding cap on upfront payment and multi-year commitments exceeded by 
approximately $60 million); Rural Health Care Support Mechanism, WC Docket No. 02-60, Order, 35 FCC Rcd 
11696, 11698-99, paras. 7, 11 (WCB 2020) (Funding Year 2020 Demand Order) (funding year 2020 funding cap on 
upfront payments and multi-year commitments exceeded by approximately $43 million); Promoting Telehealth 
Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7400, para. 138.
134 See NCTNA/SOHCN Petition at 8.  
845Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
commitments and upfront payments from funding year 2016 to funding year 2021.135  As demonstrated by 
demand in recent funding years, removing multi-year commitments from being subject to the internal cap 
could result in costly multi-year commitment requests usurping funding from single-year requests.  We 
affirm the Commission’s earlier decision to retain the internal cap on multi-year commitments and 
upfront payments and, accordingly, deny that portion of the NCTNA/SOHCN petition.136  In the Report 
and Order below, we amend our rules so that the internal cap applies only when demand exceeds 
available funding, and when the internal cap does apply, upfront costs and the first year of a multi-year 
commitment request are prioritized over the second and third year of a multi-year commitment request.137  
2. Prioritization System  
47. We next deny SHLB’s request that we reconsider the prioritization system adopted by the 
Commission in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.138  RHC Program prioritization rules require 
that, in funding years when demand exceeds the funding cap, funding be prioritized based on rurality tiers 
and whether the area is a Medically Underserved Area/Population.139  SHLB first argues that the 
prioritization rules will result in HCF consortia, which include non-rural health care providers that are 
prioritized last when demand exceeds available funding, bearing the entire burden of RHC Program 
funding shortfalls initially.140  SHLB further argues that this impact will erode the consortia model and 
reduce the benefits of consortia for rural health care providers.141  We disagree and find the Commission 
reasonably concluded that, to further the goals of section 254(h) of the Act, it should prioritize funding 
based on the rurality of the health care provider’s location, as well as on the level of medical care need in 
that location.142  This prioritization scheme targets support to rural areas that are less likely to have access 
to telecommunications and advanced services while still providing support for health care consortia that

Apr. 1, 2022).  
136 NCTNA/SOHN also request that the Commission consider a “carry-forward process” by which unused funding 
from upfront payments and multi-year commitments be carried forward specifically for commitments above the 
internal cap in a given funding year.  NCTNA/SOHN Petition at 10.  We decline to adopt an HCF-specific carry-
forward process because of the funding flexibility already afforded to us with the RHC Program-wide carry-forward 
provision, which is designed to fund future year requests in accordance with the public interest.  See 47 CFR § 
54.619(a)(4); see also Funding Year 2019 Demand Order, 35 FCC Rcd at 2663-64, para. 12 (carrying forward 
unused funds to cover funding year 2019 demand).

142 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7389, para. 115.  Congress intended for section 254(h) 
to assist health care providers in rural areas with affordable access to modern communications services to enable 
them to provide medical services to all parts of the nation.  See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h); H.R. Rep. No. 104-458, at 131 
(1996) (Conf. Rep.) (explaining that Congress intended section 254(h) “to ensure that health care providers for rural 
areas . . . have affordable access to modern telecommunications services that will enable them to provide medical . . 
. services to all parts of the Nation” and that “[t]he ability of . . . rural health care providers to obtain access to 
advanced telecommunications services is critical to ensuring that these services are available on a universal basis.”); 
see also Universal Service First Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd at 8795, para. 31 (stating the “level of discounts 
correlated to indicators of poverty and high cost [i.e., rurality] for schools and libraries . . . satisfies section 
254(h)(1)(B)’s directive that the discount be an amount that is ‘appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable 
access to and use of’ the services eligible for the discount.’”). 
846Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
include non-rural health care providers.143  Thus, while SHLB is correct in noting the benefits that rural 
health care providers receive as members of consortia,144 we are not persuaded that these consortia 
warrant higher funding priority over the most rural and medically underserved health care providers.  
When the Commission adopted the rules permitting HCF consortia, it limited program participation in a 
“fiscally responsible” manner so as not to jeopardize funding for rural healthcare providers.145  The 
prioritization system adopted in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order aligns with this fiscally 
responsible approach and we decline to reconsider it here.146
3. Medically Underserved Areas and Populations  
48. We decline to revise our use of the Medically Underserved Areas and Populations 
(MUA/P) designation to determine funding prioritization based on medical need.  The U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) designates an area as 
MUA/P when the area lacks sufficient primary care services.147  SHLB requests that we revise HRSA’s 
data by clarifying that all areas in counties with a population density below twenty persons per square 
mile will be considered to be MUA/P, arguing that many such sparsely populated areas have never sought 
MUA/P designation but are nonetheless underserved.148  We decline to adopt SHLB’s requested 
modification.  As the Commission explained in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the MUA/P 
designation is well-suited for determining prioritization in the Telecom Program because it is objective 
data from another Federal agency that shows the areas that currently lack health care services and 
therefore would most benefit from the availability of telehealth services.149  In addition, relying on 
HRSA’s determination is straight-forward and easy to administer.150  SHLB did not provide any data that 
would enable the Commission to verify its claim that many sparsely populated areas have declined to seek 
a MUA/P designation from HRSA.151  Furthermore, we decline to add administrative complexity to this 
paradigm by adding population density into the determination.
D. Certifications
49. We deny USTelecom’s request that we reconsider the requirement adopted in the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order that service providers certify on invoices submitted to the 
Administrator that consultants or third parties hired by a service provider do not have an ownership 
interest, sales commission arrangement, or other financial stake in the service provider or, in the 
143 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7389, para. 115. (“Prioritizing limited funding [to 
health care providers in more rural areas] fulfills the Commission’s statutory mandate to preserve and advance 
universal service.”).
144 See SHLB Petition at 8.
145 See Healthcare Connect Fund Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 16707, para. 61.
146 SHLB also argues that the Commission “ignor[ed] serious practical challenges USAC [the Administrator] will 
likely face implementing the new prioritization regime as it applies to consortia.”  SHLB Petition at 6.  We disagree 
and note that the Administrator has created IT systems to implement the Commission’s prioritization rules.  While 
we decline to reconsider the prioritization system, the amendment to our rules we adopt today in the Report and 
Order to have the internal cap apply only when overall demand exceeds available funding alleviates the impact on 
non-rural health care providers when funding requests for upfront payments and multi-year commitments must be 
prioritized.  See infra Part IV.B; Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.621(b), as adopted herein.

alternative, that we clarify that this certification applies only on a forward-looking basis.152  In response to 
this request, the Bureau clarified that the prohibition on third party commission arrangements does not 
apply to competitive bidding processes completed before funding year 2020.153
50. We decline, however, to eliminate this certification and now address the arguments that 
USTelecom raised in its petition for reconsideration.  We disagree with USTelecom’s argument that the 
Commission did not provide adequate notice for this new requirement.154  The Commission sought 
comment in the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on “whether to require healthcare providers and 
service providers to certify that the consultants and outside experts they hire do not have an ownership 
interest, sales commission arrangement, or other financial stake in the vendor chosen to provide the 
requested service.”155  USTelecom’s argument ignores that the certification language adopted in the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order stems directly from the language used in the Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking.  
51. Second, while USTelecom acknowledges that the use of consultants that have financial 
relationships with vendors raises conflict of interest concerns for RHC Program applicants, we disagree 
with USTelecom that there are no such concerns for commissioned consultants working for service 
providers.156  Similar concerns are applicable to service providers who have commissioned sales 
agreements with other third parties based on contracts awarded through the Program.  For example, there 
have been previous instances where a service provider’s sales agent apparently shared other carriers’ 
confidential pricing information to provide an unfair competitive advantage to that service provider when 
it responded to a health care provider’s request for services.157  In addition, commissioned consultants or 
sales agents who simultaneously represent multiple service providers could direct business toward the 
service provider that pays the highest commission or has the highest bid to maximize their earnings.158  
Such conflicts of interest and anti-competitive conduct violate the Program’s longstanding fair and open 
competitive bidding requirement, which the Commission codified in the Promoting Telehealth Report 
and Order.159  We therefore clarify that agents compensated solely by commission, and not just those that

are compensated partly by commission are covered by the rules.160  Finally, we note that USTelecom 
argues that because the E-Rate Program does not prohibit the use of commissioned consultants or sales 
agents by service providers and that the Commission has sought to harmonize the E-Rate and RHC 
Programs, the RHC Program should not prohibit their use.  We disagree.  While USTelecom is generally 
correct that the Commission has sought to harmonize requirements between RHC and E-Rate, the greater 
likelihood of RHC consultant misconduct justifies a different requirement in the RHC Program at this 
time.161  As such, we affirm the certification rule and deny USTelecom’s request to strike this 
requirement, which applies to competitive bidding practices from funding year 2020 forward.
52. Additionally, we deny USTelecom’s request to clarify that a service provider certification 
addressing “eligible services” does not include an attestation that the services for which the disbursement 
is sought are eligible for Program support.162  In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the 
Commission adopted a requirement that service providers certify they have “charged the health care 
provider for only eligible services prior to submitting the invoice form and accompanying 
documentation.”163  USTelecom argues that this certification should be interpreted not to apply to the 
eligibility of the services, arguing that service providers are not responsible for determining the eligibility 
of services, and that requiring service providers to make such a certification will preclude them from 
including both eligible services and services not supported by the Program on the same bill submitted to 
the applicant.164  On the contrary, the new certification, one of several added to invoicing forms to 
improve the invoicing process and ensure compliance with Commission rules,165 does not create a new 
burden because service providers are already required to abide by Program service eligibility rules.166  
While service providers may include ineligible services and eligible services on the invoices they submit 
to health care providers, it is critical that service providers engage in due diligence to ensure that they 
seek reimbursement from the Administrator for eligible services only.  Service providers are in the best 
position to evaluate whether the services they provide are eligible for RHC Program support because they 
understand the technical details of the services they provide.  We therefore confirm that service providers 
are certifying to the eligibility of the services provided when they certify that they “charged the health 
care provider for only eligible services prior to submitting the invoice form and accompanying 
160 See USTelecom Petition at 17, n.4 (suggesting that the prohibition may not apply to agents working solely on 
commission).  
161 Rural health care consultants sometimes provide bids from multiple service providers for a single health care 
provider, which raises concerns that the consultant could withhold lower-priced bids from the health care provider to 
maximize the sales commission.  See Petition for Expedited Declaratory Ruling Regarding the Application of 47 
C.F.R. § 54.627 and 47 C.F.R. § 54.622 of The Rural Health Care Program or in the Alternative a Waiver, WC 
Docket 17-310 (filed Feb. 9, 2021).  We further note that financial relationships between service providers and a 
consultant that is retained by the applicant violate the E-Rate program’s competitive bidding rules and are not 
allowed given the control a consultant may have over the applicant’s competitive bid process.  See Requests for 
Waiver and Review of Decisions of the Universal Service Administrator by Akisha Networks, Inc., et al., Order, 27 
FCC Rcd 8294, 8295-96, para. 2 (WCB 2012) (“A consultant, acting on behalf of the applicant, exerts great 
influence on an applicant’s bidding process and thus, should not have a financial relationship with a service provider 
which it selects (or recommends) on behalf of the applicant.”).

documentation.”167  We clarify that with respect to billing, service providers may include both eligible and 
ineligible services on a single bill to the health care provider but RHC Program reimbursement may only 
be sought for eligible services.168  
53. Finally, we make one minor change to the Telecom Program certifications and issue an 
additional clarification as sought by USTelecom.  First, in order to eliminate the potential for confusion, 
we grant USTelecom’s request169 to update Telecom Program certifications to add the word “form” after 
“invoice” to bring the certification in line with the HCF Program certifications.170  Second, we clarify, as 
USTelecom requests, that a service provider need not ensure that a health care provider is current on its 
payments before certifying that the health care provider has “paid the appropriate urban rate.” 171  Having 
outstanding balances on payments owed to a service provider does not necessarily mean that the health 
care provider did not pay the appropriate urban rate.
IV. SECOND REPORT AND ORDER
54. In this Second Report and Order, we amend the Telecom Program invoicing process to 
harmonize the RHC invoicing process across the Telecom Program and the HCF Program.  We also 
amend our funding cap and prioritization rules to limit the application of the internal cap and prioritize 
health care providers’ current year financial need over their future year need when the internal cap is 
exceeded.  Additionally, we make minor changes to the text of the RHC Program rules regarding the 
number of health care provider types that are eligible in the RHC Program.  These actions will promote 
efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and minimize the possibility that some health care 
providers may not receive their current year’s support in the event of prioritization to upfront payment 
and multi-year commitment requests, while strengthening protections against waste, fraud, and abuse.
A. Invoicing
55. To closer harmonize the invoicing process across the Telecom Program and the HCF 
Program, we eliminate the use of Health Care Provider Support Schedules (HSSs) in the Telecom 
Program and require the participating service provider and health care provider to submit an invoice for 
service to the Administrator after services are provided consistent with the HCF Program effective for 
funding year 2024.172  In the Further Notice, we proposed to fully harmonize the invoicing process 
between the Telecom Program and the HCF Program by having participants in both programs invoice the 
Administrator for services actually provided using the FCC Form 463 (Invoice and Request for 
Disbursement Form).173  Additionally, we proposed to retire the FCC Form 467 (Connection 
Certification), which is currently used for invoicing in the Telecom Program.174
167 Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7425, para. 193. 47 CFR §§ 54.627(c)(3)(ii)(G)), 
54.627(d)(1)(ii)(E).
168 Service providers submit the FCC Form 463 (for the HCF Program) or the Telecommunications Program invoice 
form (Telecom Program) to the Administrator to request reimbursement through the RHC Program.  The service 
provider’s customer bill to the health care provider is not submitted to the Administrator for reimbursement.  Thus, 
the customer bill may include both eligible and ineligible services, but the invoice form (i.e., the FCC Form 463 or 
the Telecom Program invoice form) submitted to the Administrator must seek reimbursement for only eligible 
services and/or equipment.  Any ineligible items on the customer bill may not be included in the invoice form 
submitted to the Administrator.

invoicing process across both Rural Healthcare Program programs). 
173 See id. at para. 76. 
850Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
56. We adopt our proposal to eliminate HSSs in the Telecom Program and retire the FCC 
Form 467.175  Eliminating the use of HSSs in the Telecom Program will stop payments being disbursed 
automatically with minimal action from the health care provider or service provider.176  Because the FCC 
Form 467 is the form filed before a health care provider can receive an HSS, it will no longer be 
necessary and will be eliminated.177  However, rather than adopt the FCC Form 463 for the Telecom 
Program as proposed, we instead direct the Administrator, upon approval from the Bureau, to adopt a new 
invoice form for the Telecom Program that will be filed after services have been provided, and will allow 
participants to indicate when services have started, and will more clearly identify what services RHC 
Program applicants receive during the funding year while maintaining separation between the HCF 
Program and Telecom Program invoicing processes.  
57. Creating a new Telecom Program invoicing form, which is distinct from, but functionally 
similar to, the FCC Form 463 will ensure that invoicing in the Telecom Program occurs after services 
have actually started, that service providers are reimbursed for actual costs rather than predetermined 
amounts established by the HSS, and that participants need not take action to change an HSS if the 
services are terminated or never begin.  Having distinct forms for each program will account for the fact 
that there are consortium applications in the HCF Program but not in the Telecom Program.  Additionally, 
we find that adopting this process for invoicing in the Telecom Program will further alleviate 
inefficiencies and protect against waste, fraud, and abuse in the RHC Program. This new process for 
invoicing will eliminate the need for health care providers to file, and subsequently amend, an FCC Form 
467.  It will also reduce the likelihood of improper disbursements because disbursements will be based on 
charges for services that were actually provided rather than expected charges for services anticipated to 
be provided.178  
58. Service providers will initiate the invoicing process by preparing the new Telecom 
invoicing form and service providers and health care providers will continue to make the same 
certifications on the new form that they have previously made on Telecom invoicing forms.179  As with 
HCF Program invoices, invoices in the Telecom Program can be submitted any time after services have 
been provided and the service provider sends an invoice to the health care provider.  A service provider 
can submit an invoice form to the Administrator after each month of service or, if it elects to, may 
alternatively wait until the end of the funding year to submit a single invoice for all services provided 
during the funding year.  All invoices for services actually incurred must be submitted before the invoice 
filing deadline, consistent with Commission rules.180  
59. Some commenters raised concerns that adopting a system in which disbursements are

Comments at 2 (supporting the streamlining of the Telecom Program invoice process and discussing the elimination

invoicing processes would increase administrative burdens and possibly disrupt funding disbursements.  See ENA 
Comments at 8-9, GCI Comments at 18, SLHB Comments at 21.  See also ADS Reply Comments at 3.  For the 
reasons discussed herein, we find that preventing improper payments outweighs added administrative burdens.

unnecessary because health care providers would no longer need to file the form to receive HSSs.”). 
178 This invoicing process allows service providers to bill for actual charges even if the actual charges are lower than 
the anticipated charges that the funding commitment is based on.  
179 See 47 CFR § 54.627(c)(3).  
180 See 47 CFR § 54.627(b).
851Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
made based on invoices filed after services are provided, rather than a predetermined HSS for the 
Telecom Program, would increase administrative burdens, and these burdens could be exacerbated by the 
fact that invoices in the Telecom Program can be submitted only on an individual basis, rather than on a 
consortium basis.181  Other commenters supported harmonizing the invoicing processes so long as there 
are mechanisms to reduce increased administrative burdens.182  We recognize that adopting an invoicing 
system based upon actual expenses incurred will likely require more invoice-related filings from program 
participants, but the history of improper disbursements from the use of the HSS justifies any potential 
added burden.183  To mitigate any administrative burdens,184 we direct the Bureau to work with the 
Administrator to develop a mechanism for filing this new form and to provide service providers the 
functionality to file invoices for multiple funding requests for multiple health care providers in a single 
filing. 
B. Internal Cap Application And Prioritization
60. We adopt the changes to the RHC Program internal cap application and prioritization 
proposed in the Further Notice effective funding year 2023.185  We amend RHC Program rules to limit the 
application of the internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments to funding years for 
which the total demand exceeds the remaining support available.186  We also prioritize upfront payments 
and the first year of multi-year commitments, and then fund the second and third years of multi-year 
commitments with any remaining funding in a given funding year.187  Although demand has been fully 
satisfied in every funding year since the adoption of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, these 
changes will ensure a smoother, fairer process in the event that prioritization is ever necessary.
61. First, we amend our funding cap rules to limit the application of the internal cap to those 
application filing window periods during which total demand exceeds total remaining support available 
for the funding year.188  All commenters who discussed this proposal supported it.189  If total demand 
during a filing window period does not exceed total remaining support available for the funding year, the 
internal cap will not apply.  The total remaining support available for the first filing window period of a 
funding year is the sum of the inflation-adjusted RHC Program aggregate cap in section 54.619(a)190 of 
181 See ENA Healthcare Comments at 8-9.  See also SHLB Reply Comments at 10; GCI Reply Comments at 18.  We 
also reject SHLB’s request to direct USAC to change its systems to bill for actual charges instead of funding 
commitment amounts in lieu of making a rule change.  See Letter from Kristen Corra, Policy Counsel, Schools, 
Health & Libraries Broadband (SHLB) Coalition to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-310, 3-4 
(filed Jan. 17, 2023).  Our comprehensive reform will more effectively streamline the Telecom Program invoicing 
process and better protect Program integrity than SHLB’s proposal.   
182 See ANTHC Comments at 2, 5; see also Windstream Comments at 8-9 (“Not only do Health Care Provider 
Support Schedules (‘HSSs’) ‘compromise the ability of USAC to administer the Telecom Program effectively and 
efficiently,’ but they also complicate the invoicing process for participating service providers, particularly those that 
also participate in the HCF Program, where only FCC Form 463 is used.”).
183 See, e.g., TeleQuality Communications, LLC, EB-IHD-19-00028870, Order and Consent Decree, 35 FCC Rcd

Communications, LLC invoiced USAC for services that were disconnected before the end of the funding period or
were not actually installed and provided).

our rules and the proportion of unused funding determined for use in the RHC Program pursuant to 
section 54.619(a)(5).191  
62. This approach will preserve the internal cap’s intended purpose of preventing multi-year 
and upfront payment requests from encroaching on the funding available for single-year requests,192 
because the internal cap would only apply when the total demand exceeds the total remaining support 
available.  No requests will be reduced, even if the internal cap is exceeded, as long as there is sufficient 
total funding to meet total demand.  This approach will also ensure funding for single-year requests in the 
next funding year.193  Allowing upfront payment and multi-year commitment requests to be fully funded if 
funding is available for all demand in the current funding year will also alleviate demand in the next 
funding year given that funding multi-year commitment requests in the current funding year eliminates 
demand for those services under the next funding year’s cap.    
63. Second, we amend our rules to prioritize support for current-year funding requests over 
future-year funding requests when the internal cap is exceeded.194  Specifically, we amend section 54.621 
of our rules to fund eligible upfront payment requests and the first-year of all multi-year requests before 
funding the second or third year of any multi-year requests when the internal cap applies and is 
exceeded.195  Additionally, we amend our rules to allow the underlying contracts associated with those 
multi-year commitment requests that are not fully funded to be designated as “evergreen.”196
64. The amendment to the prioritization process we adopt today increases the chance that 
health care providers who requested support for upfront payments and multi-year commitments will have 
their current year’s financial need satisfied in the event that prioritization is necessary.  The previous 
prioritization process would have resulted in some health care providers, likely those in the lower 
(Continued from previous page)  
190 47 CFR § 54.619(a).
191 47 CFR § 54.619(a)(5).  In the event that a second filing window is opened during a funding year, the total 
remaining support available for the second filing window is the total remaining support after allocating funding to 
eligible funding requests during the first filing window.  47 CFR § 54.621(a)(2).  The last funding year in which 
there was a second filing window was funding year 2016, and a second filing window is not currently planned for 
future funding years given that there has been no available funding for a second filing window in recent funding 
years.  See Wireline Competition Bureau Provides a Filing Window Period Schedule for Funding Requests Under 
the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund, WC Docket No. 02-60, Public Notice, 31 FCC 
Rcd 9588, 9591 (WCB 2016) (directing USAC to open a second filing window period for funding year 2016).  If the 
total demand during a second filing window exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, 
funding for upfront payment and multi-year commitment requests submitted during the second filing window will be 
capped at the remaining support available within the internal cap.  For example, if the internal cap for the funding 
year is $161 million and support for eligible upfront payments and multi-year commitments during the first filing 
window is $130, the remaining support available within the internal cap is $31 million.
192 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7401, para. 138 (“the $150 million cap did the job 
the Commission intended when it was established – to prevent multi-year and upfront payment requests from 
usurping the funding available for single-year requests for recurring services and safeguard against large fluctuations 
in demand for RHC Program funds.”); Healthcare Connect Fund Order, 27 FCC Rcd at 16802, para. 298.
193 See Alaska Communications Comments at 34 (stating that any attempt to retain the internal cap must prevent 
multi-year and upfront payment requests from encroaching on single-year requests).  
194 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.621(b), as adopted herein.
195 See id.  Commenters support this proposal. See PCIA Comments at 2; WNY Comments at 1.  Under this 
approach, the second and third years of a request for a multi-year commitment that fall within the same prioritization 
tier would be treated equally. 
196 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.621(b)(4), as adopted herein.  As noted below, such contracts must 
satisfy the criteria set forth in section 54.622(i)(3)(ii) of the Commission’s rules.  47 CFR § 54.622(i)(3)(ii).  
Commenters also support this proposal.  See WNY Comments at 2.

prioritization categories, losing all or a portion of their requested support for the current funding year 
while other health care providers receive commitments for the second and third years of multi-year 
commitments, even though they could request funding for these services in subsequent funding years.  
This change mitigates such adverse impact to those health care providers.  By prioritizing support for 
upfront payment requests and the first year of multi-year commitment requests when the internal cap 
applies and is exceeded, health care providers in the lower prioritization categories will more likely 
receive the current year’s requested support.  Additionally, the action we take today will further promote 
broadband network development led by HCF consortia that include non-rural members by lessening the 
impact of prioritization to those non-rural health care providers and by giving preference to upfront costs 
such as network construction.  We recognize that this amendment will inconvenience some health care 
providers in the higher prioritization categories that may have to file applications in future funding years 
for services that otherwise would fall under the second and third year of a multi-year commitment.  We 
conclude, however, that such concerns are outweighed by the benefit to health care providers who, 
without this rule change, could have their current year funding requests denied or prorated.
65. To mitigate any potential adverse impact to health care providers whose multi-year 
commitment requests are affected, we also amend our rules197 to allow the underlying contracts associated 
with those multi-year commitment requests that are not fully funded to be designated as “evergreen,” 
provided that the contracts satisfy the criteria set forth in section 54.622(i)(3)(ii) of the Commission’s 
rules.198  The evergreen designation will exempt applicants from having to complete the competitive 
bidding process for multi-year contracts that are not initially fully funded due to our new internal cap 
rules when the applicant subsequently files requests for support pursuant to these contracts.199  As a result, 
applicants can request single or multi-year commitments pursuant to these contracts in the next funding 
year without going through the competitive bidding process. 
66. We agree with Alaska Communications, GCI, and WNY that the internal cap prevents 
multi-year commitment requests from usurping funding available for single-year requests,200 and we reject 
requests by some commenters to eliminate the internal cap or to remove multi-year commitments from 
the internal cap.  This latter group of commenters claims that eliminating the internal cap or removing 
multi-year commitments from the internal cap would encourage more multi-year commitments, which 
these commenters claim are more efficient for both the RHC program and individual HCPs.201  We find 
that retaining the current internal cap with the limitations we institute today is more fiscally responsible 
than eliminating the internal cap or removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap.  Eliminating 
the cap or removing multi-year commitments from the internal cap will result in less funding being made 
available for single year commitments.  Multi-year requests tend to be more expensive and without any 
constraints, those requests will make it more likely that the overall cap is exceeded.  In any event, the

directed USAC to designate the eligible underlying contracts as “evergreen.”  See Rural Health Care Support

854Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
changes we adopt for the internal cap today will likely result in making more funding available for multi-
year commitments because, going forward, the internal cap will only apply when total demand exceeds 
total support available and thus will not apply at all in funding years when total support available can 
satisfy total demand, leaving open the possibility for additional funding for multi-year commitments 
beyond the internal cap.
67. We also reject some commenters’ requests to suspend the funding prioritization system 
until the Commission addresses the allocation of shared network costs for consortia program 
participants.202  As an initial matter, we did not seek comment in the Further Notice on suspending the 
funding prioritization scheme.  We find, however, that a rule change is not necessary for the Commission 
to ensure that consortium members can allocate shared network costs when some members do not receive 
funding due to prioritization.  In any event, as discussed in the Order on Reconsideration above, our 
funding prioritization approach remains necessary as it will target support where it is most needed (i.e., 
those more rural areas with greater medical shortages) in cases where available program funding is 
exceeded in a given funding year.203  We therefore reject the requests to suspend the funding prioritization 
system. 
68. Some commenters argued that an increase to the overall RHC Program cap is 
appropriate.204  We find that the current annually inflation-adjusted overall cap combined with the process 
to carry-forward unused funding strikes the necessary balance between providing sufficient funding to 
health care providers and minimizing increased burden on USF contributors.205  With the availability of 
carryover funding, demand has been fully satisfied since funding year 2019.206  While we continue to 
monitor overall Program demand, we decline to increase the overall RHC Program cap at this time.
C. Technical Changes to Previously Codified RHC Rules
69. We also take this opportunity to make two minor corrections to the text of the RHC 
Program rules.  First, we amend the text of section 54.622(e)(1)(i) to reflect the correct number of health 
care provider types that are eligible.  The Rural Healthcare Connectivity Act of 2016 amended the 
Communications Act of 1934 to add skilled nursing facilities to the list of health care provider types 
eligible to receive RHC Program support.207  In response to this new law, in 2017, the Commission 
amended section 54.600(a) of its rules to reflect that skilled nursing facilities are eligible for RHC 
support, which increased the number of eligible health care provider types from seven to eight.208  In

enacting this change, the Commission did not amend a different rule addressing certifications on a 
Request for Services that refers to “one of the seven categories set forth in the definition of health care 
provider.”209  We now correct that omission by striking the word “seven” from section 54.622(e)(1)(i) of 
our rules.  Striking the word “seven” rather than replacing it with “eight” is appropriate because 
quantifying the number of eligible health care provider types in section 54.622(e)(1)(i) adds no 
substantive benefit to RHC Program participants but could potentially lead to confusion if there are future 
amendments to the health care provider types eligible for the RHC Program.  Second, we correct the 
cross-reference in section 54.622(a) so that it properly references section 54.622(i).210  We find that there 
is good cause to make these changes without notice and comment because seeking comment on these 
technical amendments, which only serve to conform these references to the current requirements of the 
rules would be unnecessary.211  
V. ORDER
70. By this Order, we dismiss the Applications for Review of the Bureau’s guidance to the 
Administrator on implementation of the Rates Database212 submitted by Alaska Communications and 
GCI.213  Our decision above to eliminate the use of the Rates Database to calculate urban and rural rates 
renders these Applications for Review moot.214  
VI. SECOND FURTHER NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING
71. In this Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we first propose modifications to 
the three rural rate determination methods in the Telecom Program, including changes to the market-
based approach of Methods 1 and 2 and new evidentiary requirements for justifying cost-based rates 
under Method 3.  We also propose to simplify urban rate rules by eliminating the “standard urban 
distance” distinction and seek specific comment on sources for urban rates as well as general comment on 
our urban rate rules.  Next, we seek comment on reinstating the cap on support for satellite services that 
the Commission eliminated when it adopted the Rates Database and on amending HCF Program rules to 
make equipment supporting Telecom Program services eligible.  In addition, to make it easier for health 
care providers to receive RHC Program funding as soon as they become eligible entities, we propose a 
conditional eligibility process to allow entities that will be eligible health care providers in the future to 
engage in competitive bidding and file Requests for Funding before they become eligible.  We also 
propose to align the deadline to request a Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN) change with the 
invoice filing deadline and seek comment on a post-commitment process to amend evergreen contract 
dates.  We conclude by seeking comment on proposed revisions to FCC Form 466 intended to improve 
the quality of Telecom Program data.
A. Rural Rates
72. In the Order on Reconsideration above, we grant the petitions seeking reconsideration of 
the Telecom Program Rates Database and restore Methods 1, 2, and 3 for calculating rural rates in the 
209 See 47 CFR § 54.603(b)(1)(i) (2018) (emphasis added).  This section has subsequently been re-codified as 47 
CFR § 54.622(e)(1)(i).  See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7451, Appx. A.  
210 See 47 CFR § 54.622(a) (currently citing to “an exemption listed in paragraph (j) in this section” despite the fact 
that competitive bidding exemptions are listed in section 54.622(i).  
211 See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B); see also 47 CFR § 1.412(c).  
212 See Rates Database Implementation Letter.  Because the Rates Database has been rescinded, this letter no longer 
has any legal effect.  
213 See GCI Application for Review; Alaska Communications Application for Review.
214 Because we dismiss the Applications for Review as moot, we need not determine whether the Applications for 
Review, which asked the Commission to review guidance by the Bureau directed to the Administrator, met the 
procedural requirements of section 1.115 of our rules.  See 47 CFR § 1.115.   
856Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
Telecom Program effective for funding year 2024.  Although we believe restoring Methods 1, 2, and 3 is 
the best of our currently available options to ensure that healthcare providers have adequate, predictable 
support in the short term, we also recognize that improvements to these methods may be necessary for the 
long term given the issues that the Commission has previously cited with respect to these rate calculation 
methodologies.215  Therefore, in the following sections, we propose modifications to the three methods to 
improve the overall calculation of rural rates, make rate calculations simpler to administer, and reduce 
waste, fraud, and abuse in the Telecom Program for funding year 2024 and beyond.  Our proposals are 
similar to the now-reinstated Methods 1 through 3 in that they contain multiple ways to calculate rural 
rates that are applied sequentially.  While we seek comment specifically on our proposed modification to 
the methods, at the outset we seek comment generally on alternative rural rate calculation methods.  In 
proposing alternative rate methodologies, commenters should be specific, point the Commission to 
available data sources to support any alternative methodology, and explain how any alternative 
methodology would be more advantageous in protecting the Fund against waste, fraud, and abuse.
73. As an initial matter, we address several matters applicable to rural rates regardless of the 
method used.  For both market-based calculations and cost-based rates, we propose that the rural rate not 
exceed the monthly rate in the contract or other applicable agreement between the service provider and 
health care provider.216  This safeguard exists in the rules related to the Rates Database217 and ensures that 
rural rates will drop if market prices drop.  We seek comment on this proposal.  Are there situations in 
which it would be appropriate to base support on an amount higher than the monthly rate in the contract 
or other applicable agreement?  
74. Additionally, we propose that service providers with multi-year contracts, including 
evergreen contracts, continue to be required to justify rural rates only in the first year of the contract.  
Given that service providers would not be expected to submit additional bids within the duration of the 
multi-year contract,  we believe it would be reasonable to exempt such contracts from requiring additional 
rural rates justifications during the duration of the contract.  We seek comment on this proposal.  We also 
seek comment on whether a rural rate approval for a single year contract for the same health care provider 
for the same service should be effective for multiple funding years to reduce administrative burdens 
associated with filing rural rate justifications every year.  If so, for how many years should an approval be 
effective?  
75. We seek comment on whether the Commission should offer guidance on which point in 
the procurement and funding cycle service providers should determine rural rates.218  The Bureau 
previously advised that service providers should determine the rural rate before responding to a health 
care provider’s request for bids.219  If the Commission offers further guidance, should it alter the guidance 
the Bureau previously offered?   We also seek comment on whether additional clarification is needed  
regarding what constitutes “comparable rural areas” for determining rural rates.220  Are health care 
providers and service providers currently able to determine what constitute a “comparable rural area?”  If 
the Commission were to offer a clarification on what constitutes “comparable rural areas,” what should 
the clarification state?

857Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
1. Market-Based Calculations  
76. The rules that we reinstate today require health care and service providers to first 
calculate the rural rate by averaging rates offered by the service provider for an identical or similar 
service in the rural area in which the health care provider was located (Method 1), and in the event the 
service provider does not provide such a service, the average of rates offered by carriers other than the 
service provider (Method 2).221  We now propose alternative sequential methods for determining rural 
rates, which we call “Method A” and “Method B” for purposes of this Second Further Notice:222
Method A: The rural rate shall be the median of publicly available rates charged by other service 
providers223 for the same or similar services over the same distance in the rural area where the 
health care provider is located.
Method B:  If there are no publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same 
or similar services (that is, rates that can be used under Method A), the rural rate shall be the 
median of the rates that the carrier actually charges to non-health care provider commercial 
customers for the same or similar services provided in the rural area where the health care 
provider is located.  
This proposal differs from Methods 1 and 2 in two primary respects.  First, our new proposed calculations 
would be based on the median of inputs, rather than their average.  Calculating rural rates using the 
median will mute the effect that a small number of abnormally high or low inputs would have on the 
calculated rural rate.224  We seek comment on this methodology.  Would calculating rural rates using 
averages be preferable to using medians?  If so, why?  Are there other ways that we should consider 
calculating rural rates?
77. The second major way that our proposal varies from Methods 1 and 2 is that the default 
calculation in our proposal is based on rates charged by other service providers, meaning that a service 
provider would only be able to use its own rates to calculate the rural rate if there are no applicable rates 
from other service providers.  This change could improve program integrity and provide administrative 
benefits.  As to program integrity, shifting the default rural rates calculation to rates from other service 
providers could ensure that rural rates in the Telecom Program better reflect market conditions.  A service 
provider would not enjoy inflated rural rates simply because it charges inflated rates to customers outside 
of the Telecom Program.  We seek stakeholder feedback on program integrity implications of our 
proposal to use rates charged by other service providers as the default for calculating rural rates.  Are 
there any concerns with service providers using competitor’s rates to determine rural rates instead of 
using their own rates?  What are the benefits?  Are there benefits to using the service provider’s own rates 
as the default as Method 1 does?  
78. As to administration, the availability of rural rates on the Open Data platform on the 
Administrator’s website could simplify the rates determination process if the Administrator were to build 
a tool that allows the filer of a Request for Funding to select the specific funding requests, i.e., prices 
from past request that would be used as inputs to Method A.  The tool would then determine the rural rate 
under Method A on behalf of the health care provider before it certifies its Request for Funding.  Unlike 
the Rates Database, which we have eliminated in the Order on Reconsideration above, this automated 
process would not pre-determine which health care provider is in a similar rural area as the health care 
provider applicant.  That would be left to the service provider to determine.  During application review, 
221Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7363, para. 54.
222 See Appendix B, 47 CFR § 54.605(a)(1) and (2) as proposed herein.  
223 “Other service providers” are considered any service provider with a different SPIN.
224 See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7366, para. 63.  
858Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
the Administrator would verify that the sites from the inputs are in a similar rural area to the health care 
provider, just as it has done under the now reinstated Methods 1 and 2.    
79. We seek comment on developing an automated process to calculate rural rates, to the 
extent possible, by having USAC’s website auto-generate the rural rate after the health care and/or service 
provider selects sites that are in the same rural area as the HCP.  Would this help alleviate administrative 
burdens associated with calculating rural rates?  Should filers be permitted to add rural rates outside of 
Open Data to be included in the calculation?  Are there any circumstances in which a filer should be 
permitted to exclude a rate even if the rate is for the same or similar services over the same distance in the 
rural area where the health care provider is located?  Are there any disadvantages to automating the rate 
calculation process in this way?  Would a challenge process outside of the normal appeals process be 
necessary?  If so, how should such a challenge process operate?  Do commenters have any alternative 
methods of administering these proposed rate methodology changes that would increase efficiency and 
transparency?  Commenters are encouraged to provide specific suggestions and feedback on how we can 
best administer changes to the rates determination process.
80. We seek comment on other iterations of the proposed Methods A and B above.  For 
instance, one alternative to our proposal would be to use the lower of the rural rates calculated under 
Methods A and B.  This alternative would ensure that the Fund reaps the benefits of reductions in pricing 
from the service provider for the applicable funding request or in the overall market.  We seek comment 
on the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.  
81. We also seek comment on the rates that should be used for Methods A and B under our 
proposal.  For Method A, are there other sources of publicly available rate information that we should 
consider, such as tariffed rates?  Should Method A inputs be limited to data available in Open Data?  Do 
commenters agree that the data available in Open Data would be sufficient for Program participants to 
determine a rural rate under Method A?  If not, what additional information would be required in Open 
Data to make such a rate determination?  For the proposed Method B, we seek comment on whether we 
should include the median of all of the service provider’s own rates for the same or similar services, 
including rates for USF-supported services, which are currently excluded from Method 1 calculations 
either in situations where there are no publicly available rates or tariffed rates outside of the service 
provider’s own rates or in all situations.  For Method B, should service providers use additional 
information available in their own records to make a more granular similarity determination? 
82. For both proposed Methods A and B, we seek comment on whether we should include 
both healthcare provider and non-healthcare provider commercial customers in the rural area in which the 
healthcare provider is located to calculate the rural rate.  Do commenters have any concerns with allowing 
service providers to rely on all of their own rates, including health care provider rates?  How should 
Methods A and B account for the potential price variations caused by term and volume discounts?  Do 
commenters have any concerns that the proposed Methods would not be suitable for health care providers 
in Alaska?  Commenters are encouraged to be specific with their concerns.  
2. Cost-Based Rates  
83. We propose that service providers continue to have the option to submit a cost-based rate 
if they cannot calculate a rural rate using Methods A or B.  Under the rate determination rules we reinstate 
today, service providers may request approval of a cost-based rate under Method 3 from the Commission 
(for interstate services) or a state commission (for intrastate services) if there are no rates for the same or 
similar services in the rural area in which the health care provider is located, or the service provider 
reasonably determines that the calculated rural rate would not be compensatory.225  The Commission’s 
rules require the service provider to submit a justification of its requested rural rate, including an 
225 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.605(b), as adopted herein.
859Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
itemization of the costs of providing the service requested by the eligible health care provider.226  To 
comply with this requirement, the request for approval of a cost-based rural rate requires service providers 
to include a cost study that demonstrates how the costs of providing services were allocated to RHC 
Program customers.227
84. In the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission eliminated the cost-
based method of determining rates and instead concluded that submitting a cost-based rate should serve 
only as a safety valve for service providers that have no other means of determining a rural rate.228  The 
Commission reasoned that implementation of the Rates Database made it unlikely that service providers 
would be unable to determine a rural rate with the data provided in the database.229  The Commission 
established a waiver process that allowed service providers to use a cost-based rate mechanism in 
“extreme cases” where the provider could show that the applicable rural rate from the Rates Database 
“would result in objective, measurable economic injury.”230  Now that we have eliminated the Rates 
Database and reinstated the previous rate determination rules, we propose to modify the cost-based rate-
determination method to include specific evidentiary requirements to increase transparency in how 
service providers calculate cost-based rates when a rural rate cannot be calculated under Methods A or B 
or the carrier reasonably determines that the rural rate calculated under Methods A or B would not 
generate a reasonably compensatory rate.
85. We propose a revised cost-based method that will require service providers seeking 
approval of a cost-based rate to satisfy the same evidentiary requirements that the Commission adopted as 
required for waiver of the Rates Database rules in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.231  When 
service providers submit a cost-based rate, we propose to require service providers to include all financial 
data and other information to verify the service provider’s assertions, including, at a minimum, the 
following information: 
•“Company-wide and rural health care service gross investment, accumulated depreciation, 
deferred state and federal income taxes, and net investment; capital costs by category 
expressed as annual figures (e.g., depreciation expense, state and federal income tax expense, 
226 See Appendix A, Final Rules, 47 CFR § 54.605(b)(1), as adopted herein (“The carrier must provide, to the state 
commission, [f]or intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for interstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, 
including an itemization of the costs of providing the requested service”). 
227 In 2019, the Commission released a public notice providing guidance to program applicants on what should be 
included in the cost study.  At a minimum, the cost study required a service provider to submit information on the 
following: “a) The company’s total capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), with a 
breakdown of the total figure’s components (e.g., depreciation, taxes, return on investment); b) An explanation of 
how the total CAPEX/OPEX figure is allocated between customers, together with the resulting allocated figures, as 
necessary to show how the company has allocated CAPEX/OPEX costs to its RHC Program customers; c) The 
company’s total common costs and a breakdown of that total figure’s components; and d) An explanation of how the 
company’s total common costs are allocated between customers, together with the resulting allocated figures, as 
necessary to show how the company has allocated common costs to RHC facilities and to RHC Program 
customers.” Rural Rates Public Notice, 34 FCC Rcd 533.  However, these specific evidentiary requirements were 
not codified.  
228 The Commission eliminated the cost-based support mechanism and concluded that cost-based reviews “should 
not be an alternative method of determining a rural rate under our rules but instead should be reserved for extreme 
cases where a carrier can demonstrate that determining Telecom Program support under the new rural rate rules 
adopted by this Report and Order would result in an objective, measurable economic injury.”  Promoting Telehealth 
Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7369, para. 71.

return on net investment); operating expenses by category (e.g., maintenance expense, 
administrative and other overhead expenses, and tax expense other than income tax expense); 
the applicable state and federal income tax rates; fixed charges (e.g., interest expense); and 
any income tax adjustments;
•An explanation and a set of detailed spreadsheets showing the direct assignment of costs to 
the rural health care service and how company-wide common costs are allocated among the 
company’s services, including the rural health care service, and the result of these direct 
assignments and allocations as necessary to develop a rate for the rural health care service;
•The company-wide and rural health care service costs for the most recent calendar year for 
which full-time actual, historical cost data are available;
•Projections of the company-wide and rural health care service costs for the funding year in 
question and an explanation of these projections;
•Actual monthly demand data for the rural health care service for the most recent three 
calendar years (if applicable);
•Projections of the monthly demand for the rural health care service for the funding year in 
question, and the data and details on the methodology used to make that projection;
•The annual revenue requirement (capital costs and operating expenses expressed as an annual 
number plus a return on net investment) and the rate for the funded service (annual revenue 
requirement divided by annual demand divided by 12 equals the monthly rate for the service), 
assuming one rate element for the service, based on the projected rural health care service 
costs and demands; 
•Audited financial statements and notes to the financial statements, if available, and otherwise 
unaudited financial statements for the most recent three fiscal years, specifically, the cash 
flow statement, income statement, and balance sheets.  Such statements shall include 
information regarding costs and revenues associated with, or used as a starting point to 
develop, the rural health care service rate; and 
•Density characteristics of the rural area or other relevant geographical areas including square 
miles, road miles, mountains, bodies of water, lack of roads, remoteness, challenges and costs 
associated with transporting fuel, satellite and backhaul availability, extreme weather 
conditions, challenging topography, short construction season, or any other characteristics 
that contribute to the high cost of servicing the health care providers.”232 
86.  We understand that stakeholders generally disfavored the evidentiary requirements for 
the cost-based waiver for determining rural rates because of the burdensome nature of the information 
requested, the possibility that the cost-based method would not provide sufficient support for those that 
could not calculate their rates using the Rates Database and the fact that these evidentiary requirements go 
far beyond the evidentiary requirements for Method 3.233  However, the Commission adopted the waiver 
process as a safety valve given how infrequently the cost-based method has been used in the Telecom 
Program’s history and the small likelihood that providers could not determine the rural rate using the 
232 34 FCC Rcd at 7371-72, para. 74.
233 See Alaska Communications Application for Review, WC Docket No. 17-310 at 18 (filed July 30, 2020) (Alaska

310, at 22 (filed July 30, 2020) (GCI AFR) (arguing that the waiver process is “flawed and untested” and did not 
provide an adequate remedy for program applicants especially given the pervasiveness of the database’s arbitrary 
results).
861Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
Rates Database.234  We believe that such a comprehensive cost-based process would likely incentivize 
service providers to make every effort to justify their rates under Methods A or B, which would be much 
simpler for both the Administrator and service providers.  Nonetheless, in addition to our proposal, we 
seek comment on alternative evidentiary requirements that can assist the Bureau and Administrator in 
evaluating cost-based rates in the event that service providers have no other way of determining rates.  Do 
commenters have any recommendations that would increase transparency and efficiency in submitting 
and reviewing cost-based rates?  How common would it be for service providers to have to use this cost-
based rates process?  Are there changes that we can make to the proposed cost-based rates submission 
process that would mitigate administrative burdens on service providers without compromising Program 
integrity?  How should service providers and the Bureau use the cost data to determine a cost-based rate 
to be charged to an individual customer?  Should there be a deadline by which the Bureau must complete 
its cost-based rate review and issue a rate determination?  If so, how would such a deadline operate in the 
event that a service provider submitted incomplete or inaccurate information that required additional 
submissions to the Bureau?  Would the use of cost studies to determine maximum rural rates decrease 
incentives for new infrastructure investment in hard to serve areas?  Do commenters have any concerns 
that the proposed cost-based rate would not be suitable for health care providers in Alaska?  Commenters 
are strongly encouraged to share specific recommendations.
B. Urban Rates
87. We next propose to simplify and seek further comment on future urban rate 
determination rules for the Telecom Program.  The Telecom Program subsidizes the difference between 
the urban rate for a service in the health care provider’s State, which must be “reasonably comparable to 
the rates charged for similar services in urban areas in that State,” and the rural rate, which is “the rate for 
similar services provided to other customers in comparable rural areas” in the State.235  The rules that we 
restore on reconsideration today state that urban rates “shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or 
publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city 
with a population of 50,000 or more in that state.”236  Following the decision in today’s Order on 
Reconsideration to eliminate the Rates Database and restore the previous rules for determining urban rates 
effective funding year 2024, we propose to simplify the urban rate rule by eliminating the “standard urban 
distance” distinction from it and now seek comment on whether any additional changes to those rules are 
warranted.  
88.Standard urban distance.  The rules that we reinstate today provide that, if the service is 
provided over a distance greater than the standard urban distance, which is the average of the longest 
diameters of all cities with a population of 50,000 or more within a state, the urban rate is the rate no 
higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate provided over the standard urban distance.237  
The Promoting Telehealth Report and Order eliminated the standard urban distance distinction in 
adopting the Rates Database.238  We propose to eliminate this distinction between services provided over 
and within the standard urban distance and to base all urban rates calculations on rates provided in a city, 
rather than over the standard urban distance.  We expect that eliminating this distinction will simplify the 
process for determining an urban rate and will not adversely impact most health care providers because

862Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
few Telecom Program participants calculate urban rates using the standard urban distance.  We seek 
comment on the impact that this would have on urban rates and administrative burdens.  Before the 
adoption of the Rates Database, how common was it to base urban rates calculations on services in a city 
(rather than services over the standard urban distance)?  Would urban rates increase unduly if we make 
this change?  We seek comment below on whether to change the standard for “urban” from a city with a 
population of at least 50,000.  Will changes to the standard for “urban” in conjunction with the 
elimination of the standard urban distance cause an increase in urban rates? 
89.Sources of urban rates.  Under the pre-funding year 2020 urban rate rules that we 
reinstate today, documentation may be required to substantiate the applicable urban rate.239  The urban 
rate is determined by the health care provider, often with the assistance of a consultant or carrier, and 
reported on the FCC Form 466.  To document the urban rate, health care providers may use “tariff pages, 
contracts, a letter on company letterhead from the urban service provider, rate pricing information printed 
from the urban service provider’s website or similar documentation showing how the urban rate was 
obtained.”240  In the alternative, health care providers have historically utilized the urban rates listed on 
the Administrator’s website for certain services in certain states.241  These urban rates are determined by 
reviewing tariff information on file with the Commission.242  One advantage of utilizing the urban rates 
posted to the Administrator’s website is that health care providers did not need to provide additional 
documentation on their FCC Form 466.  With the Commission’s decision to eliminate the Rates Database, 
should the Administrator post urban rates as it did prior to the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order or 
is the posting of urban rates of limited utility and unnecessary?  Are there changes or updates the 
Administrator should make to the urban rates it posts on its website?  While the Commission has made 
the decision to eliminate the Rates Database, the database contains urban rates that were collected as part 
of the database creation process.  If the Administrator resumes posting urban rates, should the urban rates 
currently found in the Rates Database be included in the posted list, or have too many anomalies been 
identified that will preclude the use of those rates by participants in the Telecom Program? 
90. On a forward going basis, should there be any changes to the now-reinstated urban rate 
rules?  When exploring additional sources of urban rates, should the Commission allow health care 
providers to use the median of urban rates in the Rates Database as the urban rate?  Parties lodging 
complaints about the use of the Rates Database to determine rural rates had relatively few complaints 
about its use to determine urban rates.243  Should the Commission require the Administrator to maintain a 
Rates Database for urban rates and require that urban rates be calculated utilizing the Rates Database?  
Alternatively, should a rate survey be used to determine current urban rates instead of relying on the 
Administrator to determine and post rates?  If so, after the initial compilation of the survey, how often 
should it be updated?  Are there any additional factors that we should take into account for calculating 
urban rates in the Telecom Program?

is there a value collected by a different agency that better captures the picture of an urban area?
C. Network Function
92. We next seek comment on two matters related to how networks function.  First, we seek 
comment on reinstating the cap on support for satellite services that was in place before the adoption of 
the Rates Database.  We then seek comment on the eligibility in the HCF Program of equipment that 
supports services funded in the Telecom Program.  
1.  Satellite Services
93. We seek comment on reinstating the cap on support for satellite services in the Telecom 
Program at the amount of support the health care provider would have received for similar terrestrial-
based services.246  When the Commission established the RHC Program, satellite service was the only 
available telecommunications service available in some rural areas.  However, rural health care providers 
in those areas generally did not receive Telecom Program discounts because satellite service rates 
typically did not vary between urban and rural areas.247  In 2003, the Commission revised its rules to 
allow eligible rural health care providers to base Telecom Program support for satellite services on urban 
rates for functionally similar wireline services.248  However, because satellite services were often 
significantly more expensive than terrestrial-based services, in rural areas where a functionally similar 
terrestrial-based service was available the Commission capped support for satellite service at the amount 
that the health care provider would receive had it chosen the terrestrial-based service.249  If an eligible 
rural health care provider chose a satellite-based service that was more expensive than the available 
equivalent terrestrial-base service, the health care provider was responsible for the additional cost.250  In 
the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, the Commission eliminated this cap, effective for funding 
year 2020, explaining that the limitation on support for satellite services was no longer necessary because 
rural rates would be determined by the Rates Database and costs for satellite services were decreasing, 
while also acknowledging that eliminating the cap furthered technological neutrality and that 
improvements to competitive bidding rules would reduce the need for the cap.251
94. We seek comment on reinstating the cap on satellite services at the lower of the satellite 
service rate or the terrestrial service rate and allow rural health care providers to receive discounts for 
satellite service up to the amount providers would have received if they purchased functionally similar 
terrestrial-based alternatives, even where terrestrial-based services are available.  It appears that the 
constraints on the price of satellite services that the Commission predicted when it eliminated the cap on 
satellite services did not come into fruition.  Since the elimination of the cap and the waiver of the rates 
database, Telecom Program support for satellite services has increased significantly.  The table below 
shows that commitments for satellite services dipped slightly in funding year 2020 but increased 
significantly after that.252

95. This steady growth in demand for satellite services may demonstrate the need to 
reinstitute the satellite funding cap.  Without the constraints on support for satellite services imposed by 
the Rates Database, it appears that commitments for satellite services could increase to an unsustainable 
level.  As an initial matter, we seek comment on the significance of the increase in commitments for 
satellite services.  Does this increase reflect that the prices charged for satellite services in the Telecom 
Program increased after the cap was eliminated or are health care providers selecting satellite services 
because those services are now more competitive with terrestrial-based services?  Are service providers 
less likely to bid on or upgrade networks for terrestrial services because the cap was lifted?  Have rates 
for satellite services due to the availability of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites dropped enough to make 
the cap no longer necessary?  If that is the case, why did demand for satellite services increase so 
significantly in recent years?  Are there other factors we should consider in determining whether to retain 
the cap on support for satellite services?  For example, is it appropriate to apply the cap in cases where 
satellite service provides redundancy in the absence of alternative terrestrial-based route diversity?  Could 
reinstatement of the cap discourage investment in LEO satellites?  What impact should the RHC 
Program’s historical preference for technological neutrality and the fact that there previously was a cap on 
satellite services have on this determination?  If we reinstitute this cap, are there other changes we should 
make to it?  Should the Commission not apply the cap to funding requests supported by satellite service 
contracts that were entered into before reinstatement of the cap?  Do commenters in Alaska have any 
concerns with reinstating the cap, given the importance of satellite service in Alaska? 
2. HCF Program Eligible Equipment 
96. We also seek comment on whether we should amend HCF Program rules to make eligible 
network equipment necessary to make functional an eligible service supported under the Telecom 
Program.253  Current HCF Program rules restrict the eligibility of network equipment for individual 
applicants to equipment necessary to make functional an eligible service supported under the HCF 
Program.254  There is no analogous rule in the Telecom Program that provides support for network 
equipment.  Should we consider allowing HCF-eligible equipment to support both HCF and Telecom 
Program services?  Would such a change improve the reliability of Telecom Program supported services?  
If we were to make network equipment for Telecom Program supported services eligible, what would the 
financial impact be on the RHC Program?  Would HCF Program funding for equipment supporting 
Telecom Program services reduce Telecom Program expenditures?  Expanding the universe of supported 
equipment would make it more likely that the internal cap would be exceeded.  Given the significantly 
higher discount rates already offered in the Telecom Program, would it be sensible to increase the 
likelihood of exceeding the internal cap to provide HCF Program funding to support networks that

traditionally have been supported in the Telecom Program only?  If we implement this change, are there 
additional safeguards we should consider?  
D. Conditional Approval of Eligibility for Future Eligible Heath Care Providers
97. We propose to amend RHC Program rules for determining eligibility to allow entities that 
are not yet but will become eligible health care providers in the near future to begin receiving RHC 
Program funding shortly after they become eligible.255  Under the Bureau-level Hope Community Order, 
entities that are not yet eligible health care providers cannot receive an eligibility approval, which is a 
prerequisite to initiating competitive bidding and filing a Request for Funding, until they are eligible 
health care providers.256  As a result of this restriction, if a health care provider does not receive an 
eligibility approval in time to complete competitive bidding and file a Request for Funding by the close of 
the application filing window on April 1,257 the health care provider would have to wait until a subsequent 
funding year to receive RHC Program funding, which could result in a delay of a full calendar year.258  
98. In order to address this delay in funding, we propose to amend sections 54.601 and 
54.622 of our rules to allow entities that will soon be eligible health care providers to request and receive 
a “conditional approval of eligibility.”259  Once the Administrator approves an applicant’s conditional 
eligibility, the applicant could proceed to conduct competitive bidding and submit a Request for Funding 
during the application filing window.  To ensure that no funding is disbursed for entities that are not yet 
eligible, the Administrator would not issue a funding decision for the funding request until the entity 
updates its eligibility request by providing documentation showing that it is an eligible health care 
255 Eligible health care providers, as defined in section 254(h)(7)(B) of the Communications Act and implemented in 
the Commission’s rules, are limited to public or non-profit entities falling into one of the following categories: (1) 
post-secondary educational institutions offering health care instruction, teaching hospitals, and medical schools; (2) 
community health centers or health centers providing health care to migrants; (3) local health departments or 
agencies; (4) community mental health centers; (5) not-for-profit hospitals; (6) rural health clinics; (7) skilled 
nursing facilities; and (8) consortia of health care providers consisting of one or more entities falling into the first 
seven categories.  See 47 U.S.C. §§ 254(h)(1)(A), (h)(2)(A), (h)(4), (h)(7)(B); 47 CFR §§ 54.600(b), 54.601(a).

Community asserts the Barrow site provides outpatient mental health services, the prospective language … indicate 
that outpatient services will be provided at a future time,” and “we affirm [the Administrator’s] decision and find 
that Hope Barrow did not demonstrate that it was eligible as a ‘community mental health center,’ at the time of its 
FCC Form 465 submission for funding year 2013, and therefore was ineligible to receive RHC Telecommunications 
Program support.”).

17-310, at 4 (filed Dec. 9, 2022); SHLB Reply Comments at 11.  Under current rules, if a health care provider 
becomes an eligible health care provider and receives an eligibility approval on March 5, 2024, for example, there 
would not be enough time to conduct competitive bidding, which includes a minimum 28-day waiting period for 
posting an FCC Form 461 or 465 on the Administrator’s website, before the April 1, 2024 close of the application 
filing window for funding year 2024.  The health care provider would have to wait until funding year 2025, which 
begins on July 1, 2025, to receive RHC Program funding.  When the Hope Community Order was adopted, there 
was a rolling application deadline, which allowed entities to begin receiving RHC Program funding within months 
of becoming eligible health care providers.  See Hope Community Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 7885, para. 4.  After 
receiving an eligibility approval, the health care provider could wait the required 28 days for competitive bidding 
and then file a Request for Funding any time during the funding year.  
259 See infra Appendix B, 47 CFR § 54.601(c).  In connection with the proposed amendments to section 54.601 of 
the Commission’s rules, we also propose to amend section 54.622(e)(1)(i) of the Commission’s rules to allow 
applicants seeking conditional approval of eligibility to certify their eligibility when submitting a Request for 
Services.  See infra Appendix B, 47 CFR § 54.622(e)(1)(i).

provider and the Administrator issues a final eligibility approval.  The conditional approval of eligibility 
process would use the same forms used to request eligibility approvals, which are the FCC Form 460 
(Eligibility and Registration Form) in the HCF Program and the FCC Form 465 (Description of Services 
Requested and Certification Form) in the Telecom Program.  
99. We seek comment on the potential impact of and mechanics of the proposed rule 
changes.  How many entities would be impacted by this change?  Are there any potential problems 
associated with this proposal or any potential negative impact on the overall RHC Program?  Are any 
additional safeguards necessary beyond the restriction against the Administrator issuing funding 
commitments before an entity receives a final eligibility approval?  Are there alternatives to our 
conditional eligibility proposal that would more effectively allow entities that are not yet eligible health 
care providers to receive RHC Program funding?  Finally, are there any RHC Program rule changes 
beyond those that we propose that would be needed to implement our conditional eligibility proposal?
E. Administrative Deadlines
100. We next address two matters involving RHC Program deadlines.  We propose to push 
back the deadline for requesting Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN) changes to align with the 
invoice deadline.  We also seek comment on whether a mechanism to allow post-commitment changes to 
evergreen contract dates is necessary.  
1. Service Provider Identification Number Change Deadlines
101. We propose to revise the current deadline for requesting Service Provider Identification 
Number (SPIN) changes from the service delivery deadline to the invoice filing deadline.  A SPIN is a 
unique number that the Administrator assigns to an eligible service provider seeking to participate in the 
universal service support programs.260  An applicant under the HCF Program or Telecom Program may 
request either a “corrective SPIN change” (in cases not involving a change to the service provider 
associated with the applicant’s funding request number) or “operational SPIN change” (in cases involving 
a change to the service provider associated with the applicant’s funding request number).261  The current 
filing deadline to submit a SPIN change request is no later than the service delivery deadline, which, with 
limited exceptions, is June 30 of the funding year for which program support is sought.262  The 
Commission established a SPIN change deadline aligned with the service delivery deadline to ensure 
consistency with the E-Rate Program and reduce the number of requests for extension of the invoice 
deadline.263   
102. SHLB requests that the Commission change the current deadline to make a corrective 
SPIN change from the service delivery deadline to the invoice filing deadline, which typically falls on 
October 28.264  SHLB maintains that the nature of corrective SPIN changes creates a “recurring hardship 
260 To obtain a SPIN, a service provider must file an FCC Form 498 with the Administrator, which refers to a 
provider’s SPIN as its 498 ID.  See USAC, Obtain a 498 ID, https://www.usac.org/rural-health-care/service-
providers/step-1-participating-in-the-rhc-program/ (last visited Jan. 26, 2023).  
261 47 CFR § 54.625(a), (b).  For example, a corrective SPIN change is requested to correct ministerial errors or 
update a SPIN that resulted from a merger or acquisition of companies, and an operational SPIN change is requested 
when the applicant has a legitimate reason to change service providers, as in the case of a breach of contract.  Id. 
The Commission adopted RHC Program SPIN change rules modeled after those of the E-Rate Program in the 
Promoting Telehealth Report and Order.  See Promoting Telehealth Report and Order, 34 FCC Rcd at 7426-27, 
paras. 197-99. 
262  Id. § 54.625(c).  The service delivery deadline is defined in section 54.626(a) of the Commission’s rules.  Id. § 
54.626(a).

264  SHLB January 17, 2023 Ex Parte.  The invoice filing deadline is 120 days after the later of: (1) the service 
delivery deadline, or (2) the date of a revised funding commitment letter issued pursuant to an approved post-
(continued….)

for applicants” unable to meet the deadline which, in turn, results in deadline waiver requests filed with 
the Commission.265  According to SHLB, two commonly recurring situations support a change to the 
corrective SPIN change deadline: (1) mergers and acquisitions that can occur at any time during the 
funding year and (2) a service provider that assigns one of its multiple SPINs to a funding request without 
advising the healthcare provider as to the correct SPIN before invoicing begins, a situation that, in many 
instances, occurs after the service delivery deadline has passed.266  SHLB maintains that changing the 
deadline to request a corrective SPIN change to October 28 will provide the Administrator with sufficient 
time to process the change request without the need for applicants to request deadline waivers from the 
Commission.267      
103. We tentatively agree with SHLB that the current deadline for requesting corrective SPIN 
changes imposes unnecessary burdens that a later-in-time deadline will largely eliminate.  Delaying the 
deadline by 120 days (from June 30 to October 28 in most cases) would reduce the need for applicants to 
seek, and for the Commission to address, waivers of the current corrective SPIN change deadline that 
result from the types of situations described by SHLB, while still maintaining an administratively 
reasonable date by which such change requests must be made.  Although SHLB focused its request on 
corrective SPIN changes only, we conclude that it may be needlessly confusing to establish two different 
SPIN change request deadlines depending on whether the request is corrective or operational in nature.  
Accordingly, we propose to change the deadline for requesting both corrective and operational SPIN 
changes from the current service delivery deadline to the invoicing filing deadline.268  We seek comment 
on this proposal.  Are there other benefits to this change?  We anticipate that one potentially undesirable 
consequence of this change is that it may cause Program participants to delay in filing SPIN change 
requests, which could result in Program participants missing the invoice deadline.  If the SPIN change 
deadline is moved to the invoice deadline and the health care provider files a SPIN change request so 
close to the deadline that the Administrator cannot process the request before the invoice deadline, the 
health care provider will not be able to submit invoices.  Does the flexibility this change would offer to 
health care providers justify the disadvantage to health care providers who are unable to invoice because 
they filed a SPIN change request too close to the deadline?  Parties often indicate that alignment between 
RHC Program rules and E-Rate Program rules eliminates confusion.  Would bringing these deadlines out 
of alignment create confusion?  Are there other reasons not to adopt the same deadline for both corrective 
and operational SPIN changes? 
2. Evergreen Contract Date Changes
104. We seek comment on whether there should be a process for health care providers to 
change evergreen contract dates following a funding commitment.  Evergreen contracts are multi-year 
agreements under which covered services are exempt from the competitive bidding requirements for the 
life of the contract.269  When the Administrator issues a funding commitment letter, it sets the period for 
an evergreen contract based on the estimated service start and end dates provided by the health care 
provider on the FCC Form 462.270  However, services sometimes start after the estimated service start

date, which means that the evergreen status of the contract expires before it would have if the evergreen 
designation period was based on the actual service start date.271  We seek comment on whether there 
should be a means for a healthcare provider to change evergreen contract dates.  Is such an alternative 
necessary and, if so, how could it be accomplished?  Would an alternative means require a change in our 
rules or could our current rules be interpreted to allow for evergreen contract date changes?  What would 
be the impact of such a change on the duration of evergreen contracts?  Would allowing program 
participants to change evergreen contract dates make it more difficult for the Administrator to process 
funding requests submitted pursuant to such contracts?        
F. FCC Form 466
105. We next seek comment on proposed revisions to the Funding Request and Certification 
Form (FCC Form 466), including service-specific details that could both improve the accuracy of similar 
service categorizations under the existing Method 1 and Method 2, or the alternatives we propose in this 
Second Further Notice, and also result in more accurate cost-based rates.  To ensure the reporting of 
accurate data, we propose to begin collecting this data from service providers because they are in the best 
position to furnish it.  
106.  In the Further Notice, we sought general comment on both existing Telecom Program 
data collected through current program forms as well as potential changes to the categorization and details 
of Telecom Program services and data reported on the FCC Form 466.272  Certain data currently collected 
appears to be too vague and fails to capture details of the purchased services, resulting in significantly 
different monthly rates for services broadly categorized that report comparable bandwidths but likely vary 
significantly.273  We requested feedback on updating the Telecom Program’s categorization of services to 
more accurately reflect the functionality and cost of services purchased by incorporating data points such 
as details of service level agreements (SLAs).274  We also sought comment on collecting data that would 
classify services based upon functionality, regardless of the commercial name used by the service 
provider to describe the service.275  We then sought general comment on revisions to the FCC Form 466 
and other Telecom Program forms and corresponding USAC online portals that would improve the 
accuracy of urban and rural rate determinations and ensure program integrity.276
107. Commenters agreed that collecting more detailed data would result in more accurate 
categorization of services purchased by health care providers and improve program transparency.277  
Alaska Communications agreed that service categorizations should be more granular and explained that 
services broadly categorized as “dedicated” include a range of services and features, particularly security 
and reliability, that significantly impact rates.278  Alaska Communications also noted that the factors 
identified in the Further Notice “can have a profound effect on the functionality of the service from the 
perspective of the end user.”279  GCI suggested that the Commission could collect data on network type, 
prioritization, and term and volume discounts.280  GCI also argued that the Commission should collect

data on services purchased rather than requiring healthcare providers to submit highly detailed forms 
when requesting service.281
108. We propose revisions to the FCC Form 466 to improve the quality, consistency, and level 
of detail of RHC Program data.  Improved data will also increase the accuracy of rural rates calculated 
through the current three rate determination methods or through any rate determination process that is 
established in the future.  Through our continued review of data currently collected on the FCC Form 466 
we have identified five primary issues impacting the ability to calculate rates: (1) services reported by 
healthcare providers are not defined by a single factor such as technology or speed; (2) some reported 
rates are based on distance whereas others are not; (3) value-added services beyond data transmission are 
not reported; (4) bundled prices offered by service providers make “apples-to-apples” rate comparisons 
difficult; and (5) the form does not measure the impact of SLAs on the rates offered.
109. To address these issues and collect more detailed, accurate data, we propose to revise the 
FCC Form 466 to collect more granular information about the services purchased by health care 
providers.  We propose to collect the following service details for each connection endpoint.282  We seek 
comment on collecting this data on the FCC Form 466 and welcome comments on additional or 
alternative service data that could improve the accuracy and fairness of Telecom Program rates.  We 
especially request recommendations for additional individual descriptors for the items listed below.  The 
following items are being considered:
•Contract Type. In many instances services reimbursed under the RHC Program are often part 
of a contract that bundles many services together.  We propose adding a field that would 
indicate if the underlying contract includes a bundle and what services the bundle covers.  
Data collected would include the total number of end points serviced, an indicator of the 
geographic region of coverage, the contract’s duration, discounts and service level 
agreements that apply to the contract, and the contract’s total price including RHC supported 
services.
•Service Details - Connection Endpoint Information.  There would be one entry for each 
endpoint.
oLocation of Endpoint – Geographically identifiable latitude and longitude.
oDistance (If Applicable) – The distance would be in line miles from this endpoint to 
the far termination endpoint of the link or the central server node.  This would be 
reported if the service provider uses it in the price calculation for this item.  This field 
would be reported in line miles and not straight-line or “crow fly” miles.
oConnectivity – Point-to-Point, Point-to-Multipoint, Multipoint-to-Multipoint
oApplication – Voice, Data, or Both
oService or Product – This is the service at the Endpoint.  The user would select from 
the following options: Link (a point-to-point transmission), Device (at an endpoint 
for a link, such as a router or switch other network-supporting equipment), or Service 
(provided capabilities using the Links and Devices).
oEquipment Vendor/Model – If a device or other equipment is used to extend the 
eligible service to the endpoint, the user would list it here.  All devices would be 
required to be listed.
281 Id. at 6, 54.
282 We define a “connection endpoint” to mean termination points set up as part of the requested communication 
service.  For example, a request for a service based upon an MPLS solution could have 10 termination points for 
several rural clinics, a central hospital, and a diagnostic center.  Under our proposal, each of the ten “connection 
endpoints” would be reported separately.  For a simple point-to-point (1:1) connection, two endpoints would be 
reported.  Additionally, an end point can be a location where a separate device, such as a repeater, modem, router, 
switch, or other supporting service, such as a server, monitoring device, etc., is located that is part of the contract.
870Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
oTechnology – The user would report the technology at the endpoint selecting from 
items such as: DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service 
Interface Specifications), PON (Passive Optimal Network), GPON (Gigabit Passive 
Optical Network and its variants), and similar, as well as Other (Describe) and N/A.
oBandwidth (Down/Up) – This would be expressed in Mbps.  
oSLA Coverage – The user would select “Yes” or “No” to indicate if this endpoint is 
covered.
oAccess Media – The user would describe the transmission media that is present at the 
termination of the endpoint at each individual facility.  This can often, but not 
always, be considered the last mile.  The user would select from: copper, cable, 
microwave, fiber, high Earth orbit satellite, LEO satellite, power line, other, and N/A.  
oMonthly Price – This field contains the monthly price in dollars and cents.  This price 
would not include any uplift for SLA coverage, which will be collected elsewhere in 
the form.  If the overall contract price is for a service such as MPLS, the price for 
each endpoint would be a pro-rated amount associated with each endpoint.  Any 
service portion that cannot be associated with an endpoint, such as MPLS 
management, would be separately reported as an individual line item(s) in the 
“Additional Services and Differentiators” section.  MPLS and similar multi-point 
solutions would not be reported as a single item.  These services would be pro-rated 
to individual endpoints.
•Additional Services and Differentiators – This question would only be used if the service 
cannot be described in the “Service Details” question.  
oService Name – This would be a free text descriptor for the provider’s name of this 
item.  
oClass – This would be a product, service, or differentiator not listed in the “Service 
Details” section because it is not associated with a single endpoint.
oCoverage Scope – This field would refer to the scope of the network and contract that 
this item covers.  
oPeriod – This field would indicate the period length in months over which this item 
will occur.  For example, if an “Installation” service is provided for the first year and 
one-half is part of the contract, “18” months would be shown.
oSLA Coverage – The user would provide a “Yes” or “No” answer to indicate if this 
service/differentiator is covered under an SLA.
oMonthly Price – This would be expressed in dollars and cents.  The provider would 
pro-rate the monthly average cost for each item if the overall contract price is a single 
number. 
110. We also propose to collect SLA details on the FCC Form 466, which currently captures 
whether there is an SLA, but does not collect specific details about it.  The specifics of an SLA appear to 
significantly impact telecommunications service rates and therefore are likely to be a key factor when 
determining whether services are similar.  SLAs are typically sold at varying levels (sometimes with 
descriptors such as Gold, Silver, or Bronze) and include availability and reliability metrics, service 
maintenance and management, delineations of service provider and customer responsibilities, and 
penalties for non-performance.  We seek comment on adding the following fields to the FCC Form 466 
and also seek comment on any additional SLA data that could improve the accuracy and fairness of 
Telecom Program rural rates, with one line for each SLA coverage area or item: 
•Target Measurement – The user would report the item or class of items to be measured such as 
Availability (Network Level Outage), Availability (Link or Endpoint Level Outage), 
Repair/Restore Times (MTTR – Mean Time To Repair), or On Site Spares (Response Time for 
Equipment Under Contract).
•SLA Level – High, Medium, or Low that may correspond to individual provider schemes, such as
oBronze, Silver, Gold.
871Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
oBasic, Standard, Premium.
oAs classified by any system the service provider may use.
•What Functions are Covered? 
oThe user selects between Operations, Performance, Maintenance, Install, Administration, 
and Compliance.
•Period – The user would indicate the period length in months over which this item will occur.  
For example, if an “Installation” service is provided for 18 months, then “18 months” would be 
shown.
•Penalties For Non-Performance? (Yes/No) – The user would indicate whether there are specific 
monetary or other penalties for carrier non-performance of specific SLA requirements written in 
the contract.  The user would select from a drop-down menu. General statements of intent would 
not constitute a penalty.
•SLA Scope – The user would report the scope of the contract that this item covers.  Examples of 
options filers would select from include: Performance (what is delivered), Operations (how it is 
managed), and  Maintenance (how it is repaired).  
•Description of Target SLA Measurement – An optional free text field the provider could use to 
enter further clarification for the specific SLA item.
•Price Uplift – The user would report the increase to the contract service price (usually represented 
as a percentage) that the SLA impacts.  If it is not a separate line item in the contract, then the 
price would be estimated and/or pro-rated by the provider over the period and scope of SLA 
coverage.
111. We seek comment on whether we should apply the proposed revisions to FCC Form 466 
to the HCF Funding Request Form (FCC Form 462) for consistency.  What are the benefits and/or 
drawbacks of revising FCC Form 462 to collect more granular service data?
112.Service Provider Filing.  We propose to require service providers to report the technical 
service details described above on the FCC Form 466.  In the Further Notice, we sought comment on 
whether service providers should report certain technical information about services purchased that rural 
health care providers either cannot access or lack the technical expertise to report.283  Commenters 
expressed concerns about increasing technical reporting burdens on healthcare providers.  GCI argued 
that any new collection process should not burden rural health care providers, who are often “not well 
positioned to supply technical and granular details about the services they need,” and suggested collecting 
additional data through the FCC Form 466.284  Alaska Communications acknowledged that reporting 
technical service data would be complicated for health care providers.285  ANHB and ANTHC both 
supported increased data collection but cautioned against increasing reporting burdens on Tribal and other 
health care providers.286
113. We agree with commenters that proposed increases in the level of detailed technical data 
required on the FCC Form 466 would likely exceed the technical expertise of most health care providers.    
The service providers are in the best position to understand the difference between a commercial term and 
a functional capability as well as the difference between a capability and the underlying technology.  We 
therefore propose that service providers input service information into the FCC Form 466.  We tentatively 
conclude that shifting the responsibility for providing technical details to the service provider would 
reduce burdens on healthcare providers and improve data quality and consistency.  We propose that 
service providers provide the technical connection endpoint data listed above as well as any other 
283 Further Notice at 17, para. 43.

872Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
technical service data that is recommended by commenters and ultimately adopted by the Commission as 
part of this proceeding.  Additionally, we propose that the service providers include the actual contract as 
an attachment to the FCC Form 466.  This would be treated confidentially and would document the 
carrier’s answers in an official company document.  To ensure the accuracy of the information provided, 
we propose that the service provider certify to the accuracy of service provider-supplied information.  We 
seek comment on these proposals.  
114. We also seek comment on the logistics of service providers filling out portions of the 
FCC Form 466.  We propose that the FCC Form 466 be transferred to the service provider after the health 
care provider completes the certifications on its portion of the FCC Form 466.  We seek comment on how 
service providers completing part of the FCC Form 466 would impact program deadlines.  Should the 
filing window close denote the health care provider’s deadline for completing its portion of the FCC 
Form 466?  If so, how much time should service providers have to complete their portion of it?  Finally, 
we seek comment on the extent to which there might be a miscommunication between health care and 
service providers about the requested services.  In limited circumstances, service providers may be 
selected to provide RHC Program supported services without submitting a bid in response to an RFP.287  
If there is no contract, how can we ensure that health care providers and service providers agree as to the 
specific services that will be provided?
G. Digital Equity and Inclusion
115. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,288 
including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and others 
who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty 
or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations289 and benefits (if any) that may be 
associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein.  Specifically, we seek comment on how our 
proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well the 
scope of the Commission’s relevant legal authority.
VII. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
116.Regulatory Flexibility Act.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended 
(RFA),290 requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for notice-and-comment 
rulemaking proceedings, unless the agency certifies that “the rule will not, if promulgated, have a 
287 For example, if a health care provider does not receive responsive bids to its RFP, it may use a pre-existing 
contract as a “standing bid.”  Request for Review of the Decision of the Universal Service Administrator by 
Kalamazoo Public Schools, Kalamazoo, Michigan, Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Changes to the 
Board of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier Association, Inc., CC Docket Nos. 96-45 and 97-21, Order on 
Reconsideration, 17 FCC Rcd 22154 (WCB 2002).
288 Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended provides that the FCC “regulat[es] interstate and 
foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make [such service] available, so far as possible, to 
all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or 
sex.”  47 U.S.C. § 151.
289 The term “equity” is used here consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, 
and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have 
been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons 
otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  See Exec. Order No. 13985, 86 Fed. Reg. 7009, 
Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal 
Government (January 20, 2021).
290 The RFA, see 5 U.S.C. §§ 601-612, was amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.”291  Accordingly, the Commission 
has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) concerning rule and policy changes in the 
Order on Reconsideration and Second Report and Order.  The FRFA is set forth in Appendix C.  It has 
also prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) concerning potential rule and policy 
changes contained in the this Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  The IRFA is set forth in 
Appendix D.
117.Paperwork Reduction Act.  This document contains proposed new or modified 
information collection requirements.  The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce 
paperwork burdens, invites the general public and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to 
comment on the information collection requirements contained in this document, as required by the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13.  In addition, pursuant to the Small Business 
Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(4), we seek specific comment 
on how we might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer 
than 25 employees.
118.Congressional Review Act.  The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of 
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, concurs, that this 
rule is “non-major” under the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 804(2).  The Commission will send 
a copy of this Order on Reconsideration, Second Report and Order, Order, and Second Further Notice of 
Proposed Rulemaking to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 
801(a)(1)(A).  The Commission will send a copy of this Order on Reconsideration and Second Report and 
Order to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A).
119.Ex Parte Rules – Permit-But-Disclose.  This proceeding shall be treated as a “permit-but-
disclose” proceeding in accordance with the Commission’s ex parte rules.292  Persons making ex parte 
presentations must file a copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral 
presentation within two business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the 
Sunshine period applies).  Persons making oral ex parte presentations are reminded that memoranda 
summarizing the presentation must (1) list all persons attending or otherwise participating in the meeting 
at which the ex parte presentation was made, and (2) summarize all data presented and arguments made 
during the presentation.  If the presentation consisted in whole or in part of the presentation of data or 
arguments already reflected in the presenter’s written comments, memoranda or other filings in the 
proceeding, the presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, 
memoranda, or other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or 
arguments can be found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum.  Documents shown or given 
to Commission staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte presentations and must 
be filed consistent with rule 1.1206(b).  In proceedings governed by rule 1.49(f) or for which the 
Commission has made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and 
memoranda summarizing oral ex parte presentations, and all attachments thereto, must be filed through 
the electronic comment filing system available for that proceeding, and must be filed in their native 
format (e.g., .doc, .xml, .ppt, searchable .pdf).  Participants in this proceeding should familiarize 
themselves with the Commission’s ex parte rules.
120.Comment Period and Filing Requirements.  Pursuant to sections 1.415 and 1.419 of the 
Commission’s rules, 47 CFR §§ 1.415, 1.419, interested parties may file comments and reply comments 
on or before the dates indicated on the first page of this document.  Comments may be filed using the 
Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS).  See Electronic Filing of Documents in 
Rulemaking Proceedings, 63 FR 24121 (1998).

123.Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities.  The reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements 
proposed in this Further Notice likely would positively and negatively financially impact both large and 
small entities, including healthcare providers and service providers, and any resulting financial burdens 
may disproportionately impact small entities given their typically more limited resources.  In weighing 
the likely financial benefits and burdens of our proposed requirements, however, we have determined that 
our proposed changes would result in more equitable, effective, efficient, clear, and predictable 
distribution of RHC support, far outweighing any resultant financial burdens on small entity participants.

APPENDIX A
FINAL RULES
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Federal Communications Commission amends 47 CFR part 
54 to read as follows:
PART 54 – UNIVERSAL SERVICE
1. The authority citation for part 54 continues to read as follows:
Authority:  47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i), 155, 201, 205, 214, 219, 220, 254, 303(r), 403, and 1302 unless 
otherwise noted.
2. Amend § 54.604 to read as follows:
§ 54.604 Determining the urban rate.
(a) Effective funding year 2024, if a rural health care provider requests support for an eligible service to 
be funded from the Telecommunications Program that is to be provided over a distance that is less than 
or equal to the “standard urban distance,” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, for the state in 
which it is located, the “urban rate” for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or 
publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in any city 
with a population of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if it were provided between two points 
within the city.
(b) If a rural health care provider requests an eligible service to be provided over a distance that is greater 
than the “standard urban distance,” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, for the state in which it 
is located, the urban rate for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or publicly-
available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service provided over the 
standard urban distance in any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if 
the service were provided between two points within the city.
(c) The “standard urban distance” for a state is the average of the longest diameters of all cities with a 
population of 50,000 or more within the state.
(d) The Administrator shall calculate the “standard urban distance” and shall post the “standard urban 
distance” and the maximum supported distance for each state on its website.
3. Amend § 54.605 to read as follows:
§ 54.605 Determining the rural rate.
(a) Effective funding year 2024, the rural rate shall be the average of the rates actually being charged to 
commercial customers, other than health care providers, for identical or similar services provided by 
the telecommunications carrier providing the service in the rural area in which the health care provider 
is located.  The rates included in this average shall be for services provided over the same distance as 
the eligible service.  The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate must not include any rates reduced 
by universal service support mechanisms.  The “rural rate” shall be used as described in this subpart to 
determine the credit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications carrier that provides eligible 
telecommunications services to eligible health care providers.
(b) If the telecommunications carrier serving the health care provider is not providing any identical or 
similar services in the rural area, then the rural rate shall be the average of the tariffed and other 
878Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
publicly available rates, not including any rates reduced by universal service programs, charged for the 
same or similar services in that rural area over the same distance as the eligible service by other 
carriers.  If there are no tariffed or publicly available rates for such services in that rural area, or if the 
carrier reasonably determines that this method for calculating the rural rate is unfair, then the carrier 
shall submit for the state commission’s approval, for intrastate rates, or for the Commission’s 
approval, for interstate rates, a cost-based rate for the provision of the service in the most economically 
efficient, reasonably available manner.
(1) The carrier must provide, to the state commission, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for 
interstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, including an itemization of the costs of 
providing the requested service.
(2) The carrier must provide such information periodically thereafter as required, by the state commission 
for intrastate rates or the Commission for interstate rates.  In doing so, the carrier much take into 
account anticipated and actual demand for telecommunications services by all customers who will use 
the facilities over which services are being provided to eligible health care providers.
4. Amend § 54.619 by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:
§ 54.619 Cap.
(a) Amount of the annual cap.  The aggregate annual cap on federal universal service support for health 
care providers shall be $571 million per funding year.  When total demand during a filing window 
period exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, an internal cap of $150 
million per funding year for upfront payments and multi-year commitments under the Healthcare 
Connect Fund Program shall apply.
(1) * * *
(2) * * *
(3) * * *
(4) * * *
(5) * * *
5. Amend § 54.621 by revising subsection (b) to read as follows:
§ 54.621 Filing window for requests and prioritization of support.
(a)* * * * *
(b)Prioritization of support.  The Administrator shall act in accordance with this section when a filing 
window period for the Telecommunications Program and the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, as 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, is in effect.  When a filing period described in paragraph (a) 
of this section closes, the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for Telecommunications 
Program and Healthcare Connect Fund Program support submitted by all applicants during the filing 
window period. 
(1)Circumstances in which prioritization applies.  If the total demand during the filing window period 
exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year, prioritization will apply in the 
following circumstances:

(i)Internal cap.  If the internal cap is exceeded, the Administrator shall determine whether demand for 
upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments exceeds the internal cap.  If such 
demand exceeds the internal cap, the Administrator shall not fund the second and third year of multi-
year commitment requests and then apply the prioritization schedule in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section to all eligible requests for upfront payments and the first-year of multi-year commitments to 
limit the demand for upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments within the 
internal cap.  If demand for upfront payments and the first year of multi-year commitments does not 
exceed the internal cap, the Administrator shall apply the prioritization schedule in paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section to the second and third year of all eligible requests for multi-year commitments until 
the internal cap is reached, to ensure that the internal cap is not exceeded.
(ii)Overall cap.  If the internal cap is not exceeded or if, after demand for upfront payments and multi-
year commitments is limited within the internal cap in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the total 
remaining demand still exceeds the total remaining support available for the funding year,  the 
Administrator shall apply the prioritization schedule in paragraph (b)(2) of this section to all 
remaining eligible funding requests.  
(2)Application of prioritization schedule.  When prioritization is necessary under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, the Administrator shall fully fund all applicable eligible requests falling under the first 
prioritization category of Table 1 before funding requests in the next lower prioritization category. 
The Administrator shall continue to process all applicable requests by prioritization category until 
there are no applicable funds remaining.  If there is insufficient funding to fully fund all requests in a 
particular prioritization category, then the Administrator will pro-rate the applicable remaining 
funding among all applicable eligible requests in that prioritization category only pursuant to the 
proration process described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(i) The Administrator shall divide the total applicable remaining funds available for the funding year by 
the applicable demand within the specific prioritization category to produce a pro-rata factor; and
(ii) The Administrator shall multiply the pro-rata factor by the dollar amount of each applicable funding 
request in the prioritization category to obtain prorated support for each funding request. 
(4) The Administrator shall designate the underlying contracts associated with any multi-year 
commitment requests that are not fully funded as a result of the prioritization process in this section as 
“evergreen” provided that those contracts meet the requirements under § 54.622(i)(3)(ii).
6. Amend § 54.622(a) as follows:
§ 54.622 Competitive Bidding Requirements and Exemptions.
(a) Competitive bidding requirement.  All applicants are required to engage in a competitive bidding 
process for supported services, facilities, or equipment, as applicable, consistent with the requirements 
set forth in this section and any additional applicable state, Tribal, local, or other procurement 
requirements, unless they qualify for an exemption listed in paragraph (i) in this section.  In addition, 
applicants may engage in competitive bidding even if they qualify for an exemption.  Applicants who 
utilize a competitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing a funding request as described 
in § 54.623.
(b) * * *
(c) * * *
(d) * * *

7. Amend § 54.627 to delete subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2), renumber current subsection 
(c)(3) as subsection (c), and revise the new subsection (c)(1)(D), all to read as follows:
§ 54.627 Invoicing Process and Certifications.
(a) * * *
(1) * * *
(b) * * *
(c) Telecommunications Program.
(1) Certifications.  Before the Administrator may process and pay an invoice, both the health care 
provider and the service provider must make the following certifications.
(i) The health care provider must certify that:
(A) The service has been or is being provided to the health care provider;
(B) The universal service credit will be applied to the telecommunications service billing account of the 
health care provider or the billed entity as directed by the health care provider;
(C) It is authorized to submit this request on behalf of the health care provider;
(D) It has examined the invoice form and supporting documentation and that to the best of its

(E) It or the consortium it represents satisfies all of the requirements and will abide by all of the relevant 
requirements, including all applicable Commission rules, with respect to universal service benefits 
provided under 47 U.S.C. 254; and
(F) It understands that any letter from the Administrator that erroneously states that funds will be made 
available for the benefit of the applicant may be subject to rescission.
(ii) The service provider must certify that:
(A) The information contained in the invoice is correct and the health care providers and the Billed 
Account Numbers have been credited with the amounts shown under “Support Amount to be Paid by 
USAC;”
(B) It has abided by all of the relevant requirements, including all applicable Commission rules;
(C) It has received and reviewed the invoice form and accompanying documentation, and that the rates 
charged for the telecommunications services, to the best of its knowledge, information and belief, are 
accurate and comply with the Commission's rules;
(D) It is authorized to submit the invoice;
(E) The health care provider paid the appropriate urban rate for the telecommunications services;
(F) The rural rate on the invoice does not exceed the appropriate rural rate;
(G) It has charged the health care provider for only eligible services prior to submitting the invoice for 
payment and accompanying documentation;
(H) It has not offered or provided a gift or any other thing of value to the applicant (or to the applicant's 
personnel, including its consultant) for which it will provide services; and
(I) The consultants or third parties it has hired do not have an ownership interest, sales commission 
arrangement, or other financial stake in the service provider chosen to provide the requested services, 
and that they have otherwise complied with Rural Health Care Program rules, including the 
Commission's rules requiring fair and open competitive bidding.
(J) As a condition of receiving support, it will provide to the health care providers, on a timely basis, all 
documents regarding supported equipment or services that are necessary for the health care provider 
to submit required forms or respond to Commission or Administrator inquiries.

APPENDIX B
PROPOSED RULES
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the Federal Communications Commission proposes to amend 
47 CFR part 54 to read as follows:
PART 54 – UNIVERSAL SERVICE
1. Amend § 54.601 to add a new paragraph (c) to read as follows:
§ 54.601 Health care provider eligibility.
* * *
(c)  Conditional Approval of Eligibility.  (1) An entity that is not a public or non-profit health care 
provider may request and receive a conditional approval of eligibility from the Administrator if 
the entity satisfies the following requirements: 
(i)  The entity is or will be physically located in a rural area defined in §54.600(e) of this subpart by 
an estimated eligibility date or, for the HCF Program only, is not located in a rural area but is or 
will be a member of a majority-rural Healthcare Connect Fund Program consortium that satisfies 
the eligible rural health care provider composition requirement set forth in §54.607(b) of this 
subpart by the estimated eligibility date;
(ii)  The entity must provide documentation showing that it will qualify as a public or non-profit 
health care provider as defined in §54.600(b) of this subpart by the estimated eligibility date; and
(iii) The estimated eligibility date must be in the same funding year as or in the next funding year of 
the date that the entity requests the conditional approval of eligibility.
(2)  An entity that receives conditional approval of eligibility may conduct competitive bidding for 
the site.  An entity engaging in competitive bidding with conditional approval of eligibility must 
provide a written notification to potential bidders that the entity’s eligibility is conditional and 
specify the estimated eligibility date.
(3)  An entity that receives conditional approval of eligibility may file a request for funding for the 
site during an application filing window opened for a funding year that ends after the estimated 
eligibility date.  The Administrator shall not issue any funding commitments to applicants that 
have received conditional approval of eligibility only.  Funding commitments may be issued only 
after such applicants receive formal approval of eligibility as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
(4)  An entity that receives conditional approval of eligibility is expected to notify the Administrator, 
along with supporting documentation for the eligibility, within 30 days of its actual eligibility 
date.  The actual eligibility date is the date that the entity qualifies as a public or non-profit health 
care provider as defined in §54.600(b) of this subpart and may be a different date from the 
estimated eligibility date.  The Administrator shall formally approve the entity’s eligibility if the 
entity meets the requirements for a public or non-profit health care provider defined in §54.600(b) 
of this subpart, provided that the entity still satisfies the requirement under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of 
this section.  Upon the entity receiving a formal approval of eligibility, the Administrator may 
issue funding commitments covering a time period that starts no earlier than the entity’s actual 
eligibility date and that is within the funding year for which support was requested.
2. Amend § 54.604 by replacing paragraphs (a) – (d) to read as follows:
883Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
§ 54.604. Determining the urban rate.  
(a) If a rural health care provider requests support for an eligible service to be funded from the 
Telecommunications Program the “urban rate” for that service shall be a rate no higher than the highest 
tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a commercial customer for a functionally similar service in 
any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if it were provided between two 
points within the city.
3. Amend § 54.605 by replacing paragraph (a) – (c) to read as follows:
§ 54.605. Determining the rural rate.   
* * * * *
(a) The rural rate shall be used as described in this subpart to determine the credit or reimbursement due 
to a telecommunications carrier that provides eligible telecommunications services to eligible health 
care providers.  
(1) The rural rate shall be the median of publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the 
same or functionally similar services over the same distance in the rural area where the health care 
provider is located (Method A). 
(2) If there are no publicly available rates charged by other service providers for the same or functionally 
similar services, the rural rate shall be the median of the rates that the carrier actually charges to non-
health care provider commercial customers for the same or functionally similar services provided in 
the rural area where the health care provider is located (Method B).
(3) Cost-based rate.  If the telecommunications carrier serving the health care provider is not providing 
any identical or similar services in the rural area or it reasonably determines that the rural rate 
calculated under sections (a)(1) or (2) would not generate a reasonably compensatory rate, then the 
carrier shall submit to a state commission, for intrastate rates, or the Commission, for interstate rates, 
a cost-based rate for the provision of the service.
(i) The carrier must provide to the state commission, for intrastate rates, or the Commission, for interstate 
rates, a justification of the proposed rural rate, which must include all financial data and other 
information to verify the service provider’s assertions, including at a minimum, the following 
information:
(A) Company-wide and rural health care service gross investment, accumulated depreciation, deferred 
state and federal income taxes, and net investment; capital costs by category expressed as annual 
figures (e.g., depreciation expense, state and federal income tax expense, return on net investment); 
operating expenses by category (e.g., maintenance expense, administrative and other overhead 
expenses, and tax expense other than income tax expense); the applicable state and federal income tax 
rates; fixed charges (e.g., interest expense); and any income tax adjustments; 
(B) An explanation and a set of detailed spreadsheets showing the direct assignment of costs to the rural 
health care service and how company-wide common costs are allocated among the company's 
services, including the rural health care service, and the result of these direct assignments and 
allocations as necessary to develop a rate for the rural health care service; 
(C) The company-wide and rural health care service costs for the most recent calendar year for which 
full-time actual, historical cost data are available; 
884Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
(D) Projections of the company-wide and rural health care service costs for the funding year in question 
and an explanation of those projections; 
(E) Actual monthly demand data for the rural health care service for the most recent three calendar years 
(if applicable); 
(F) Projections of the monthly demand for the rural health care service for the funding year in question, 
and the data and details on the methodology used to make those projections; 
(G) The annual revenue requirement (capital costs and operating expenses expressed as an annual number 
plus a return on net investment) and the rate for the funded service (annual revenue requirement 
divided by annual demand divided by twelve equals the monthly rate for the service), assuming one 
rate element for the service), based on the projected rural health care service costs and demands; 
(H) Audited financial statements and notes to the financial statements, if available, and otherwise 
unaudited financial statements for the most recent three fiscal years, specifically, the cash flow 
statement, income statement, and balance sheets. Such statements shall include information regarding 
costs and revenues associated with, or used as a starting point to develop, the rural health care service 
rate; and
(I) Density characteristics of the rural area or other relevant geographical areas including square miles, 
road miles, mountains, bodies of water, lack of roads, remoteness, challenges and costs associated 
with transporting fuel, satellite and backhaul availability, extreme weather conditions, challenging 
topography, short construction season or any other characteristics that contribute to the high cost of 
servicing the health care providers.
(2) The carrier must provide such information periodically thereafter as required by the state commission, 
for intrastate rates, or the Commission, for interstate rates.  In doing so, the carrier must take into 
account anticipated and actual demand for telecommunications services by all customers who will use 
the facilities over which services are being provided to eligible health care providers.
(b) The rural rate shall not exceed the monthly rate in the service agreement that the health care provider 
enters into with the service provider when requesting funding.
(c) Service providers engaged in multi-year or evergreen contracts are required to justify the rural rate 
only in the first year of the contract.
4. Amend § 54.622(e)(1)(i) to read as follows:
§ 54.622 Competitive Bidding Requirements and Exemptions.
* * *
(e) * * *
(1) * * *
(i)  The entity seeking supported services is a public or nonprofit health care provider that falls within one 
of the categories set forth in the definition of health care provider listed in § 54.600, or will be such a 
public or nonprofit health care provider before the end of the funding year for which the supported 
services are requested provided that the entity is requesting or has received a conditional approval of 
eligibility pursuant to § 54.601(c) of this subpart;
885Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
5. Amend § 54.625 by replacing paragraph (c) to read as follows:
§ 54.625 Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN) changes.
* * * * *
(c)  Filing Deadline.  An applicant must file its request for a corrective or operational SPIN change with 
the Administrator no later than the invoice filing deadline as defined by section 54.627.

APPENDIX C
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission included an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the 
February 2022 Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Further Notice).2  The Commission sought 
written public comment on the proposals in the Further Notice including comment on the IRFA.  The 
Commission did not receive any relevant comments in response to this IRFA.  This Final Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) conforms to the RFA.3 
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Second Report and Order
2. Through this Second Report and Order, the Commission seeks to further improve the 
Rural Health Care (RHC) Program’s capacity to distribute telecommunications and broadband support to 
health care providers– especially small, rural healthcare providers (HCPs) – in the most equitable and 
efficient manner as possible.  Over the years, telehealth has become an increasingly vital component of 
healthcare delivery to rural Americans.  Rural healthcare facilities are typically limited by the equipment 
and supplies they have and the scope of services they can offer which ultimately can have an impact on 
the availability of high-quality health care.  Therefore, the RHC Program plays a critical role in 
overcoming some of the obstacles healthcare providers face in healthcare delivery in rural communities.  
Considering the significance of RHC Program support, the Commission implements several measures to 
most effectively meet HCPs’ needs while responsibly distributing the RHC Program’s limited funds. 
3. In the Second Report and Order, we adopt proposals from the February 2022 Further 
Notice to amend RHC Program administrative processes and internal cap application and prioritization 
rules to promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and prioritize support for the current 
funding year as well as make a minor technical change to the text of our rules.4  
B. Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA
4. There were no comments filed that specifically address the rules and policies proposed in 
the IRFA.
C. Response to Comments by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration
5. Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010,5 which amended the RFA, the 
Commission is required to respond to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), and to provide a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rule(s) as 
a result of those comments.6  The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed 
rule(s) in this proceeding.
1 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, 5 U.S.C. § 601 - 612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

D. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules Will 
Apply
6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.7  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”8  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.9  A “small business 
concern” is one that:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration 
(SBA).10
7.Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.11  First, while 
there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility 
analysis, according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an 
independent business having fewer than 500 employees.12  These types of small businesses represent 99.9 
percent of all businesses in the United States which translates to 31.7 million businesses.13  
8. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”14  The 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.15  Nationwide, for tax year 2018, there 
were approximately 571,709 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less 
according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.16
7 5 U.S.C. § 603(b)(3).
8 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).
9 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small business concern” in 15 U.S.C. § 632).  
Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an agency, after consultation with 
the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes 
one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such 
definition(s) in the Federal Register.”  5 U.S.C. § 601(3).
10 See 15 U.S.C. § 632.
11 See 5 U.S.C. § 601(3)-(6).
12 See U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, What’s New With Small Business? (Oct. 2020), 
https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/22094424/Whats-New-With-Small-Business-2020.pdf.
13 Id.
14 5 U.S.C. § 601(4).
15 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction.  Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small 
organizations in this small entity description.  See IRS, Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard), Who May File Form 990-N to Satisfy Their Annual Reporting 
Requirement, https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-
organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard (last visited Jan. 26, 2023).  We note that the IRS data does not provide 
information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field.
16 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF), “CSV Files by Region,” 
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf.  The IRS 
Exempt Organization Business Master File (EO BMF) Extract provides information on all registered tax-
exempt/non-profit organizations.  The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO 
(continued….)
888Federal Communications Commission FCC 23-6
9. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”17  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census 
of Governments18 indicates that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.19  Of this number there were 
39, 931 general purpose governments (county20, municipal and town or township21) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments (independent school districts22) with 
populations of less than 50,000.23  Based on the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau data we estimate that at least 
48, 971 entities fall in the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”24
10. Small entities potentially affected by the proposals herein include eligible rural non-profit 
and public health care providers and the eligible service providers offering them services, including 
telecommunications service providers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and vendors of the services and 
equipment used for dedicated broadband networks.25
(Continued from previous page)  
BMF data for Region 1-Northeast Area (76,886), Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas (221,121), and 
Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas (273,702) which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.  
This data does not include information for Puerto Rico.

18  See 13 U.S.C. § 161.  The Census of Governments survey is conducted every five (5) years compiling data for 
years ending with “2” and “7.”  See also Census of Governments, https://www.census.gov/programs-

19 See U.S. Census Bureau, 2017 Census of Governments – Organization Table 2. Local Governments by Type and 
State: 2017 [CG1700ORG02], https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  Local 
governmental jurisdictions are made up of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or township) 
and special purpose governments (special districts and independent school districts).  See also Table 2. 
CG1700ORG02 Table Notes Local Governments by Type and State_2017. 
20 See id. at Table 5. County Governments by Population-Size Group and State: 2017 [CG1700ORG05],  
https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  There were 2,105 county governments 
with populations less than 50,000.  This category does not include subcounty (municipal and township) 
governments.  
21 See id. at Table 6. Subcounty General-Purpose Governments by Population-Size Group and State: 2017 
[CG1700ORG06], https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  There were 18,729 
municipal and 16,097 town and township governments with populations less than 50,000.
22 See id. at Table 10. Elementary and Secondary School Systems by Enrollment-Size Group and State: 2017 
[CG1700ORG10], https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/econ/gus/2017-governments.html.  There were 12,040 
independent school districts with enrollment populations less than 50,000.  See also Table 4. Special-Purpose Local 
Governments by State Census Years 1942 to 2017 [CG1700ORG04], CG1700ORG04 Table Notes Special Purpose 
Local Governments by State Census Years 1942 to 2017.
23  This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of 
Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10. While the special purpose governments category also includes 
local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on 
population size for the special purpose governments category.  Therefore, only data from independent school 
districts is included in the special purpose governments category.

1. Healthcare Providers
11.Offices of Physicians (except Mental Health Specialists).  This U.S. industry comprises 
establishments of health practitioners having the degree of M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) or D.O. (Doctor of 
Osteopathy) primarily engaged in the independent practice of general or specialized medicine (except 
psychiatry or psychoanalysis) or surgery.  These practitioners operate private or group practices in their 
own offices (e.g., centers, clinics) or in the facilities of others, such as hospitals or HMO medical 
centers.26  The SBA has created a size standard for this industry, which is annual receipts of $12 million 
or less.27  According to 2012 U.S. Economic Census, 152,468 firms operated throughout the entire year in 
this industry.28  Of that number, 147,718 had annual receipts of less than $10 million, while 3,108 firms

a. Telecommunications Service Providers
35.Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (LECs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has 
developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange services.  The closest 
applicable NAICS Code category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers.122  Under the applicable SBA 
size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.123 U.S. Census Bureau data for 
2012 indicate that 3,117 firms operated the entire year.124  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 
1,000 employees.125  Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of incumbent local 
exchange service are small businesses that may be affected by our actions.  According to Commission 
data, one thousand three hundred and seven (1,307) Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers reported that 
they were incumbent local exchange service providers.126  Of this total, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or 
fewer employees.127  Thus, using the SBA’s size standard the majority of incumbent LECs can be 
considered small entities. 
36.Interexchange Carriers (IXCs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
small business size standard specifically for Interexchange Carriers.  The closest applicable NAICS Code

primary telecommunications service activity was the provision of interexchange services.132  Of this total,

37.Competitive Access Providers.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
definition of small entities specifically applicable to competitive access services providers (CAPs). The 
closest applicable definition under the SBA rules is Wired Telecommunications Carriers and under the 
size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.134    U.S. Census Bureau data 
for 2012 indicates that 3,117 firms operated during that year.135  Of that number, 3,083 operated with 
fewer than 1,000 employees.136  Consequently, the Commission estimates that most competitive access 
providers are small businesses that may be affected by our actions. According to Commission data the 
2010 Trends in Telephone Report, 1,442 CAPs and competitive local exchange carriers (competitive 
LECs) reported that they were engaged in the provision of competitive local exchange services.137  Of 
these 1,442 CAPs and competitive LECs, an estimated 1,256 have 1,500 or few employees and 186 have 
more than 1,500 employees.138  Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of 
competitive exchange services are small businesses.

“establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and 
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using 
wired communications networks.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a 
combination of technologies.  Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network

The SBA has developed a small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers, which 
consists of all such companies having 1,500 or fewer employees.140  U.S. Census data for 2012 show that 
there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.141  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 
employees.142  Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered 
small.
39.Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.143  The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small 
if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.144  For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there 
were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.145  Of this total, 955 firms employed fewer than 1,000 
employees and 12 firms employed of 1000 employees or more.146  Thus under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of Wireless Telecommunications 
Carriers (except Satellite) are small entities.
40.The Commission’s own data—available in its Universal Licensing System—indicate that, 
as of August 31, 2018, there are 265 Cellular licensees that will be affected by our actions.147  The 
Commission does not know how many of these licensees are small, as the Commission does not collect 
that information for these types of entities.  Similarly, according to internally developed Commission 
data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of wireless telephony, including 
cellular service, Personal Communications Service (PCS), and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) 
Telephony services.148  Of this total, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees, and 152 have more

than 1,500 employees.149  Thus, using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can 
be considered small.  
41.Wireless Telephony.  Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications 
services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers.  The closest applicable SBA category is 
Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).150  Under the SBA small business size standard, 
a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.151  For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 
2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.152  Of this total, 955 firms had fewer 
than 1,000 employees and 12 firms had 1000 employees or more.153  Thus under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that a majority of these entities can be considered 
small.  According to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless 
telephony.154  Of these, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 
employees.155  Therefore, more than half of these entities can be considered small.
42.Satellite Telecommunications.  This category comprises firms “primarily engaged in 
providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or 
reselling satellite telecommunications.”156  Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite 
and earth station operators.  The category has a small business size standard of $35 million or less in 
average annual receipts, under SBA rules.157  For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show 
that there were a total of 333 firms that operated for the entire year.158  Of this total, 299 firms had annual 
receipts of less than $25 million.159  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of satellite 
telecommunications providers are small entities.
43.All Other Telecommunications.  The “All Other Telecommunications” category is 
comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services,

such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation.160  This industry also 
includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities 
connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and 
receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.161  Establishments providing Internet services or 
voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also 
included in this industry.162  The SBA has developed a small business size standard for “All Other 
Telecommunications,” which consists of all such firms with annual receipts of $35 million or less.163  For 
this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms that operated for the 
entire year.164  Of those firms, a total of 1,400 had annual receipts less than $25 million and 15 firms had 
annual receipts of $25 million to $49, 999,999.165  Thus, the Commission estimates that the majority of 
“All Other Telecommunications” firms potentially affected by our action can be considered small.
b. Internet Service Providers
44.Internet Service Providers (Broadband).  Broadband Internet service providers include 
wired (e.g., cable, DSL) and VoIP service providers using their own operated wired telecommunications 
infrastructure fall in the category of Wired Telecommunication Carriers.166  Wired Telecommunications 
Carriers are comprised of establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to 
transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, 
text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on 
a single technology or a combination of technologies.167  The SBA size standard for this category 
classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.168  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 
show that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.169  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 
1,000 employees.170  Consequently, under this size standard the majority of firms in this industry can be 
considered small.

45.Internet Service Providers (Non-Broadband).  Internet access service providers such as 
Dial-up Internet service providers, VoIP service providers using client-supplied telecommunications 
connections and Internet service providers using client-supplied telecommunications connections (e.g., 
dial-up ISPs) fall in the category of All Other Telecommunications.171  The SBA has developed a small 
business size standard for All Other Telecommunications which consists of all such firms with gross 
annual receipts of $35 million or less.172  For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that 
there were 1,442 firms that operated for the entire year.173  Of these firms, a total of 1,400 had gross 
annual receipts of less than $25 million.174  Consequently, under this size standard a majority of firms in 
this industry can be considered small.
c. Vendors and Equipment Manufacturers
46.Vendors of Infrastructure Development or “Network Buildout.”  The Commission has 
not developed a small business size standard specifically directed toward manufacturers of network 
facilities.  There are two applicable SBA categories in which manufacturers of network facilities could 
fall and each have different size standards under the SBA rules.  The SBA categories are “Radio and 
Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment” with a size standard of 1,250 
employees or less175 and “Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing” with a size standard of 750 
employees or less.”176  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that for Radio and Television 
Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment firms 841 establishments operated for the entire 
year.177  Of that number, 828 establishments operated with fewer than 1,000 employees, and 7 
establishments operated with between 1,000 and 2,499 employees.178  For Other Communications 
Equipment Manufacturing, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012, show that 383 establishments operated for

establishments that meet the SBA size standard of employment of 1,250 or fewer employees.  The number of 
“establishments” is a less helpful indicator of small business prevalence in this context than would be the number of 
“firms” or “companies.”  An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted and/or 
services are provided.  It is not necessarily identical with a single firm, company or enterprise, which may consist of 
one or more establishments.  Thus, the numbers given may reflect inflated numbers of businesses in this category, 
including the number of small businesses.  U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide information on the number of

employees.180  Based on this data, we conclude that the majority of Vendors of Infrastructure 
Development or “Network Buildout” are small.    
47.Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing.  This industry comprises establishments primarily 
engaged in manufacturing wire telephone and data communications equipment.181  These products may be 
stand-alone or board-level components of a larger system.  Examples of products made by these 
establishments are central office switching equipment, cordless and wire telephones (except cellular), 
PBX equipment, telephone answering machines, LAN modems, multi-user modems, and other data 
communications equipment, such as bridges, routers, and gateways.182  The SBA has developed a small 
business size standard for Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing, which consists of all such companies 
having 1,250 or fewer employees.183  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 266 
establishments that operated that year.184  Of this total, 262 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.185  
Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small.

such manufacturing include fire detection and alarm systems manufacturing, Intercom systems and 
equipment manufacturing, and signals (e.g., highway, pedestrian, railway, traffic) manufacturing.192  The 
SBA has established a size standard for this industry as all such firms having 750 or fewer employees.193 
U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that 383 establishments operated in that year.194  Of that number,

consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small 
entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of 
the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.”196
52. In this Second Report and Order, we take steps to minimize the economic impact on 
small entities with the rule changes that we have adopted. We amend our invoicing process to harmonize 
the process across the Telecom Program and the HCF Program.  We minimize the impact of this change 
on small entities by ensuring that there is a mechanism to allow multiple invoices to be filed in a single 
submission.  We also amend our funding cap and prioritization rules to limit the application of the internal 
cap and prioritize health care providers’ current year financial need over their future year need when the 
internal cap is exceeded.  This change will help small entities by reducing the instances in which the 
internal cap applies and prioritizing funding for the current funding year when it does.  These actions will 
promote efficiency, reduce delays in funding commitments, and minimize the possibility that some health 
care providers may not receive their current year’s support in the event of prioritization to upfront 
payment and multi-year commitment requests, while strengthening protections against waste, fraud and 
abuse.

APPENDIX D
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the 
Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Second Further Notice).  Written public comments are 
requested on this IRFA.  Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the 
deadlines for comments on the Second Further Notice provided on the first page of the item.  The 
Commission will send a copy of the Second Further Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the Second Further Notice and 
IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.3  
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules
2. Through this Second Further Notice, the Commission seeks to further improve the Rural 
Health Care (RHC) Program’s capacity to distribute telecommunications and broadband support to health 
care providers– especially small, rural healthcare providers (HCPs) – in the most equitable and efficient 
manner as possible.  Over the years, telehealth has become an increasingly vital component of healthcare 
delivery to rural Americans.  Rural healthcare facilities are typically limited by the equipment and 
supplies they have and the scope of services they can offer which ultimately can have an impact on the 
availability of high-quality health care.  Therefore, the RHC Program plays a critical role in overcoming 
some of the obstacles healthcare providers face in healthcare delivery in rural communities.  Considering 
the significance of RHC Program support, the Commission proposes and seeks comment on several 
measures to most effectively meet HCPs’ needs while responsibly distributing the RHC Program’s 
limited funds. 
3. In this Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we seek comment on proposed 
revisions to rate determination rules, the cap on support for satellite services, and revisions to data 
collected in the Telecom Program.  We also propose changes to allow health care providers to receive 
funding shortly after they become eligible, allow participants with multi-year and evergreen contracts to 
only justify rural rates in the first year of the contract, and propose changes to administrative deadlines 
such as changes to amend program rules to align the deadline for filing a Service Provider Identification 
Number (SPIN) change with the invoice deadline.
B. Legal Basis
4. The legal basis for the Second Further Notice is contained in sections 1 through 
4(g)(D)(i)-(j), 201-205, 254, 303I, and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151 through 154(i), (j), 201 through 205, 254, 303(r), and 
403.
C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rules Will Apply
5. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.4  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
1 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601–612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).

organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”5  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.6  A “small business 
concern” is one that:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration 
(SBA).7
6.Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.8  First, while there 
are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, 
according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent 
business having fewer than 500 employees.9  These types of small businesses represent 99.9 percent of all 
businesses in the United States which translates to 31.7 million businesses.10  
7. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”11  The 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.12  Nationwide, for tax year 2018, there 
were approximately 571,709 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less 
according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.13
8. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special 
5 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).
6 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small business concern” in 15 U.S.C. § 632).  
Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an agency, after consultation with 
the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes 
one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such 
definition(s) in the Federal Register.”  5 U.S.C. § 601(3).

11 5 U.S.C. § 601(4).
12 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction.  Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small 
organizations in this small entity description.  See IRS, Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations — Form 990-N (e-Postcard), Who May File Form 990-N to Satisfy Their Annual Reporting 
Requirement, https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/annual-electronic-filing-requirement-for-small-exempt-
organizations-form-990-n-e-postcard (last visited Jan. 26, 2023).  We note that the IRS data does not provide 
information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or dominant in its field.
13 See Exempt Organizations Business Master File Extract (EO BMF), “CSV Files by Region,” 
https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf.  The IRS 
Exempt Organization Business Master File (EO BMF) Extract provides information on all registered tax-
exempt/non-profit organizations.  The data utilized for purposes of this description was extracted from the IRS EO 
BMF data for Region 1-Northeast Area (76,886), Region 2-Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes Areas (221,121), and 
Region 3-Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast Areas (273,702) which includes the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii.

districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”14  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census 
of Governments15 indicates that there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general 
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.16  Of this number there were 
39, 931 general purpose governments (county17, municipal and town or township18) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments (independent school districts19) with 
populations of less than 50,000.20  Based on the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau data we estimate that at least 
48, 971 entities fall in the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”21
9. Small entities potentially affected by the proposals herein include eligible rural non-profit 
and public health care providers and the eligible service providers offering them services, including 
telecommunications service providers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and vendors of the services and 
equipment used for dedicated broadband networks.22

Governments by State Census Years 1942 to 2017 [CG1700ORG04], CG1700ORG04 Table Notes Special Purpose

20  This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of 
Governments - Organizations Tables 5, 6, and 10. While the special purpose governments category also includes 
local special district governments, the 2017 Census of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on 
population size for the special purpose governments category.  Therefore, only data from independent school 
districts is included in the special purpose governments category.

or less.24  According to 2012 U.S. Economic Census, 152,468 firms operated throughout the entire year in 
this industry.25  Of that number, 147,718 had annual receipts of less than $10 million, while 3,108 firms

2. Providers of Telecommunications and Other Services
a. Telecommunications Service Providers
34.Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (LECs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has 
developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange services.  The closest 
applicable NAICS Code category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers.119  Under the applicable SBA 
size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.120 U.S. Census Bureau data for 
2012 indicate that 3,117 firms operated the entire year.121  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 
1,000 employees.122  Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of incumbent local 
exchange service are small businesses that may be affected by our actions.  According to Commission 
data, one thousand three hundred and seven (1,307) Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers reported that 
they were incumbent local exchange service providers.123  Of this total, an estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or 
fewer employees.124  Thus, using the SBA’s size standard the majority of incumbent LECs can be 
considered small entities. 
35.Interexchange Carriers (IXCs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
small business size standard specifically for Interexchange Carriers.  The closest applicable NAICS Code 
category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers.125 The applicable size standard under SBA rules is that 
such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.126  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 indicate 
that 3,117 firms operated for the entire year.127  Of that number, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000

employees.128  According to internally developed Commission data, 359 companies reported that their 
primary telecommunications service activity was the provision of interexchange services.129  Of this total, 
an estimated 317 have 1,500 or fewer employees.130  Consequently, the Commission estimates that the 
majority of interexchange service providers are small entities. 
36.Competitive Access Providers.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
definition of small entities specifically applicable to competitive access services providers (CAPs). The 
closest applicable definition under the SBA rules is Wired Telecommunications Carriers and under the 
size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.131    U.S. Census Bureau data 
for 2012 indicates that 3,117 firms operated during that year.132  Of that number, 3,083 operated with 
fewer than 1,000 employees.133  Consequently, the Commission estimates that most competitive access 
providers are small businesses that may be affected by our actions. According to Commission data the 
2010 Trends in Telephone Report, 1,442 CAPs and competitive local exchange carriers (competitive 
LECs) reported that they were engaged in the provision of competitive local exchange services.134  Of 
these 1,442 CAPs and competitive LECs, an estimated 1,256 have 1,500 or few employees and 186 have 
more than 1,500 employees.135  Consequently, the Commission estimates that most providers of 
competitive exchange services are small businesses.
37.Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as 
“establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and 
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using 
wired communications networks.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a 
combination of technologies.  Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network 
facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including 
voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services; wired (cable) audio and video programming distribution; 
and wired broadband internet services.  By exception, establishments providing satellite television

distribution services using facilities and infrastructure that they operate are included in this industry.”136  
The SBA has developed a small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers, which 
consists of all such companies having 1,500 or fewer employees.137  U.S. Census data for 2012 show that 
there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.138  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 
employees.139  Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered 
small.
38.Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).  This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.140  The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small 
if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.141  For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there 
were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.142  Of this total, 955 firms employed fewer than 1,000 
employees and 12 firms employed of 1000 employees or more.143  Thus under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of Wireless Telecommunications 
Carriers (except Satellite) are small entities.
39. The Commission’s own data—available in its Universal Licensing System—indicate that, 
as of August 31, 2018, there are 265 Cellular licensees that will be affected by our actions.144  The 
Commission does not know how many of these licensees are small, as the Commission does not collect 
that information for these types of entities.  Similarly, according to internally developed Commission 
data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of wireless telephony, including 
cellular service, Personal Communications Service (PCS), and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) 
Telephony services.145  Of this total, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees, and 152 have more

than 1,500 employees.146  Thus, using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can 
be considered small.  
40.Wireless Telephony.  Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications 
services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers.  The closest applicable SBA category is 
Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).147  Under the SBA small business size standard, 
a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.148  For this industry, U.S. Census Bureau data for 
2012 show that there were 967 firms that operated for the entire year.149  Of this total, 955 firms had fewer 
than 1,000 employees and 12 firms had 1000 employees or more.150  Thus under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that a majority of these entities can be considered 
small.  According to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless 
telephony.151  Of these, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 
employees.152  Therefore, more than half of these entities can be considered small.
41.Satellite Telecommunications.  This category comprises firms “primarily engaged in 
providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or 
reselling satellite telecommunications.”153  Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite 
and earth station operators.  The category has a small business size standard of $35 million or less in 
average annual receipts, under SBA rules.154  For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show 
that there were a total of 333 firms that operated for the entire year.155  Of this total, 299 firms had annual 
receipts of less than $25 million.156  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of satellite 
telecommunications providers are small entities.

comprised of establishments primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services,

such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation.157  This industry also 
includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities 
connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and 
receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.158  Establishments providing Internet services or 
voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services via client-supplied telecommunications connections are also 
included in this industry.159  The SBA has developed a small business size standard for “All Other 
Telecommunications,” which consists of all such firms with annual receipts of $35 million or less.160  For 
this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms that operated for the 
entire year.161  Of those firms, a total of 1,400 had annual receipts less than $25 million and 15 firms had 
annual receipts of $25 million to $49, 999,999.162  Thus, the Commission estimates that the majority of 
“All Other Telecommunications” firms potentially affected by our action can be considered small.
b. Internet Service Providers
43.Internet Service Providers (Broadband).  Broadband Internet service providers include 
wired (e.g., cable, DSL) and VoIP service providers using their own operated wired telecommunications 
infrastructure fall in the category of Wired Telecommunication Carriers.163  Wired Telecommunications 
Carriers are comprised of establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to 
transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, 
text, sound, and video using wired telecommunications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on 
a single technology or a combination of technologies.164  The SBA size standard for this category 
classifies a business as small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.165  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 
show that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.166  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 
1,000 employees.167  Consequently, under this size standard the majority of firms in this industry can be 
considered small.

Dial-up Internet service providers, VoIP service providers using client-supplied telecommunications 
connections and Internet service providers using client-supplied telecommunications connections (e.g., 
dial-up ISPs) fall in the category of All Other Telecommunications.168  The SBA has developed a small 
business size standard for All Other Telecommunications which consists of all such firms with gross 
annual receipts of $35 million or less.169  For this category, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that 
there were 1,442 firms that operated for the entire year.170  Of these firms, a total of 1,400 had gross 
annual receipts of less than $25 million.171  Consequently, under this size standard a majority of firms in 
this industry can be considered small.
c. Vendors and Equipment Manufacturers
45.Vendors of Infrastructure Development or “Network Buildout.”  The Commission has 
not developed a small business size standard specifically directed toward manufacturers of network 
facilities.  There are two applicable SBA categories in which manufacturers of network facilities could 
fall and each have different size standards under the SBA rules.  The SBA categories are “Radio and 
Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment” with a size standard of 1,250 
employees or less172 and “Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing” with a size standard of 750 
employees or less.”173  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that for Radio and Television 
Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment firms 841 establishments operated for the entire 
year.174  Of that number, 828 establishments operated with fewer than 1,000 employees, and 7 
establishments operated with between 1,000 and 2,499 employees.175  For Other Communications 
Equipment Manufacturing, U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012, show that 383 establishments operated for

“firms” or “companies.”  An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted and/or 
services are provided.  It is not necessarily identical with a single firm, company or enterprise, which may consist of 
one or more establishments.  Thus, the numbers given may reflect inflated numbers of businesses in this category, 
including the number of small businesses.  U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide information on the number of

employees.177  Based on this data, we conclude that the majority of Vendors of Infrastructure 
Development or “Network Buildout” are small.    
46.Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing.  This industry comprises establishments primarily 
engaged in manufacturing wire telephone and data communications equipment.178  These products may be 
stand-alone or board-level components of a larger system.  Examples of products made by these 
establishments are central office switching equipment, cordless and wire telephones (except cellular), 
PBX equipment, telephone answering machines, LAN modems, multi-user modems, and other data 
communications equipment, such as bridges, routers, and gateways.179  The SBA has developed a small 
business size standard for Telephone Apparatus Manufacturing, which consists of all such companies 
having 1,250 or fewer employees.180  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that there were 266 
establishments that operated that year.181  Of this total, 262 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.182  
Thus, under this size standard, the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small.

2.  The number of “establishments” is a less helpful indicator of small business prevalence in this context than 
would be the number of “firms” or “companies.” An establishment is a single physical location at which business is 
conducted and/or services are provided. It is not necessarily identical with a single firm, company or enterprise, 
which may consist of one or more establishments. Thus, the numbers given may reflect inflated numbers of 
businesses in this category, including the number of small businesses.  U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide 
information on the number of firms for this industry. 
182 Id.  The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of 
establishments that meet the SBA size standard of employment of 1,250 or fewer employees.

pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and radio and television studio and 
broadcasting equipment.184  The SBA has established a small business size standard for this industry of 
1,250 or fewer employees.185  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 show that 841 establishments operated in 
this industry in that year.186  Of that number, 828 establishments operated with fewer than 1,000 
employees, 7 establishments operated with between 1,000 and 2,499 employees and 6 establishments 
operated with 2,500 or more employees.187  Based on this data, we conclude that a majority of 
manufacturers in this industry are small. 
48.Other Communications Equipment Manufacturing.  This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing communications equipment (except telephone 
apparatus, and radio and television broadcast, and wireless communications equipment).188  Examples of 
such manufacturing include fire detection and alarm systems manufacturing, Intercom systems and 
equipment manufacturing, and signals (e.g., highway, pedestrian, railway, traffic) manufacturing.189  The 
SBA has established a size standard for this industry as all such firms having 750 or fewer employees.190 
U.S. Census Bureau data for 2012 shows that 383 establishments operated in that year.191  Of that number, 
379 operated with fewer than 500 employees and 4 had 500 to 999 employees.192  Based on this data, we 
conclude that the majority of Other Communications Equipment Manufacturers are small.
D. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered
49. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, 
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following 
four alternatives (among others): “(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements 
or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, 
consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small 
entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of 
the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.”  We expect to consider all of these factors when we 
have received substantive comment from the public and potentially affected entities.

50. Largely, the proposals in this Second Further Notice if adopted would have no impact on 
or would reduce the economic impact of current regulations on small entities.  Certain proposals could 
have a positive economic impact on small entities.  In the instances in which a proposed change would 
increase the financial burden on small entities, we have determined that the net financial and other 
benefits from such changes would outweigh the increased burdens on small entities. 
51.Determining Accurate Rates in the Telecom Program. We propose modifications to the 
three rural rate determination methods in the Telecom Program, including changes to the market-based 
approach of Methods 1 and 2 and new evidentiary requirements for justifying cost-based rates under 
Method 3.  We also propose that participants with multi-year contracts and evergreen contracts would 
only have to justify rural rates in the first year of the contract.  We also propose to simplify the calculation 
of urban rate rules by eliminating the “standard urban distance” requirement and seek specific comment 
on sources of urban rates as well as general comment on our urban rate rules.  We propose to keep the cap 
on support for satellite services reinstated and seek comment on potential changes to it.  Lastly, we seek 
comment on proposed revisions to FCC Form 466 intended to improve the quality of Telecom Program 
data.
52.Administrative Deadlines.  We also propose to amend program rules align the deadline 
for filing a SPIN change with the invoice deadline.  If implemented, this proposal would have a positive 
impact on small health care providers because it would reduce the need for them to seek waivers of the 
current SPIN change deadline. We also seek comment on whether a mechanism to allow post-
commitment changes to evergreen contract dates is necessary.
53.Future Eligibility.  We also propose a mechanism whereby entities that are not yet 
eligible health care providers can engage in competitive bidding and file requests for funding, which 
would allow them to receive RHC Program funding shortly after they become eligible.  If implemented, 
this proposal would have a positive economic impact on small health care providers because it would 
allow them to receive RHC Program funding shortly after they become eligible.  
E. Federal Rules that May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict with the Proposed Rules
54. None.

STATEMENT OF
CHAIRWOMAN JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re: Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, Order on Reconsideration, Second Report and Order, 
Order, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WC Docket No. 17-310 (January 26, 
2023).
What do we bring with us beyond the pandemic?  It is a question we are asking in every sector of 
the economy, in every corner of this country.  Our experience with this virus has transformed so much.  It 
has changed where we live, how we work, and what we value in our lives.  It also has deepened our 
dependence on communications.  You see this across the board, but especially in healthcare.
That’s because telemedicine has moved into the mainstream.  Getting an appointment online, 
checking in with your provider, and having a practitioner diagnose at a distance are all now more 
common than ever before—and we have embraced the power of telehealth like never before.  
This technology, however, is not all new.  For more than a quarter of a century, the Federal 
Communications Commission has been supporting telemedicine.  Our groundbreaking Rural Health Care 
programs have long been a force for good, bringing affordable care to some of the most remote areas of 
the country by using communications technology to connect patient and provider.
The oldest part of our Rural Health Care Program is known as the Telecom Program.  It offers 
support to rural healthcare providers for the difference between the rates they are charged for 
communications and those they would pay for the same facilities in urban areas.  This program has been a 
quiet dynamo, helping some of the furthest-flung places in this country stay connected to first class care.  
I know, I have seen it in action in some of the most isolated communities in Alaska and Montana.  This 
program is a lifesaver.  
But a few years ago, here in Washington, this agency got ahead of itself.  It tried to “fix” the 
Telecom Program by setting up a series of databases designed to tell communities exactly what 
communications services should cost.  But this “fix” was littered with anomalies.  For instance, in Alaska 
the database featured a rate for a dedicated transmission service in the Extremely Rural tier that was lower 
than the rate for the same service in the Less Rural tier.  In California, the database showed that a 50 
Mbps connection was cheaper than a 20 Mbps connection.  Rural healthcare authorities, the providers 
serving them, and members of Congress spoke up.  They pointed out what should have been obvious: this 
database had serious flaws.  More than that, they noted that using it could lead to real problems sustaining 
connections essential for healthcare in some of the most remote locations in the United States.  
So for the last two years the Commission has waived the use of this database.  Today, we fix it for 
good.  In fact, we bid it goodbye and return to the earlier system that worked for providers and helped 
grow this telemedicine program into what it is today.  We also continue to allow participants to use 
already-approved rates for an additional two funding years, to ensure smooth operation of the program.  
Finally, we take steps to simplify our invoicing rules and reduce funding delays and we ask questions 
about how to improve the program going forward.
This is good news.  The Rural Health Care Program is one of the great gems of this agency.  It 
was early to demonstrate the power of telemedicine and its value in rural communities.  And now those 
communities are no longer outliers when it comes to telehealth technologies.  Because the pandemic has 
demonstrated just how vital they are for everyone, everywhere.  
Thank you to the staff responsible for this effort, including Matt Baker, Phil Bonomo, Bryan 
Boyle, Cheryl Callahan, Callie Coker, Adam Copeland, Chas Eberle, Jodie Griffin, Trent Harkrader, Avis 
Mitchell, Kiara Ortiz, Hayley Steffen, and Helen Zhang from the Wireline Competition Bureau; Valerie

STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER BRENDAN CARR
Re: Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, Order on Reconsideration, Second Report and Order, 
Order, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WC Docket No. 17-310 (January 26, 
2023).
Bethel, Alaska sits along the banks of the slow-moving Kuskokwim River—about 40 meandering 
miles upstream from the Bering Sea and 400 air miles west of Anchorage.  The town of about 6,000 
people is completely cut off from the road system.  You can get there by air, by sea, or in the winter, if 
you’re brave enough, by ice road.
Last summer, both Commissioner Simington and I had the chance to spend time in Bethel on a 
visit led by Senator Sullivan.  That’s where we met with the health care providers at the Yukon-
Kuskokwim Delta Regional Hospital.  It’s a 50-bed hospital that provides critical care to individuals in 
Bethel and other remote communities that are spread across a geographic area the size of Oregon.  The 
hospital houses the only emergency room in the region and, for many, it is the only source of trauma care 
and surgical services.  Much like other facilities in Alaska, the hospital’s connections and telehealth 
services are supported by the FCC’s Rural Health Care Program.
With respect to closing the digital divide in Alaska, I don’t think the FCC has always gotten it 
right when it comes to our statutory obligations.  We have been working hard to correct course, though. 
Today’s decision is another good step in the right direction.  I want to thank my colleagues for working 
with my office to improve today’s item both for the providers in Alaska and for those across the country.  
There is more work to be done, and I am committed to working with all stakeholders to get this program 
right over the long term.
In closing, I want to recognize the staff and leadership of the Wireline Competition Bureau for 
their hard work on this item.  You have my thanks, and the item has my support.

STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS
Re: Promoting Telehealth in Rural America, Order on Reconsideration, Second Report and Order, 
Order, and Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, WC Docket No. 17-310 (January 26, 
2023).
We are currently in the midst of a winter season that has seen many, including children, battling 
what some public health experts have termed a “tripledemic”—COVID, RSV, and a resurgent flu.  I can’t 
think of a better time, then, for the Commission to update, and improve, our Rural Health Care Program. 
Telehealth continues to save and improve lives for those in rural America relying on broadband for their 
next doctor’s appointment.  Growing up in a family of doctors, who serve many patients that live in rural 
America, I’ve seen and heard how important it is to ensure that rural health care providers have the same 
connectivity as their urban counterparts.  This Program is doing that hard work. 
This item has its roots in an Order the Commission adopted in 2019.  At that time, I joined then-
Commissioner Rosenworcel in dissenting from the majority’s plan to adopt a new method to determine 
support for the Telecommunications Program, often called the “Rates Database.”
1  I was worried that the Rates Database could negatively impact program participants and that 
further study was needed before we should take action.2  Unfortunately, almost immediately, my fears 
were realized and the Commission began issuing waivers due to significant anomalies that arose in the 
initial median urban and rural rate calculations in the Rates Database. 
The item we adopt today will provide Rural Health Care Program participants with much-needed 
clarity and certainty going forward.  We return the Telecom Program to the rate determination rules that 
existed prior to the 2019 Order.  We eliminate the need to rely on waivers and make additional changes to 
improve the Rural Health Care Program rules to increase efficiency and reduce delay.
At the same time, we take this opportunity to improve, in a thoughtful manner, the rate 
determination rules.  Importantly, in proposing to update the rules going forward in today’s Further 
Notice, we propose and seek comment on two new methods to determining rural rates.  We propose 
rational methods that should make the process simpler while also protecting the Universal Service Fund 
from waste, fraud, and abuse.  These proposals should make it easier for eligible health care providers to 
receive support as soon as they become eligible.  But, in proposing these changes in the Further Notice, 
we give those who serve some of the most remote health care providers an opportunity to weigh in and 
help inform our rulemaking. I hope they do so. 
Last, in 2019, and 2022, I repeatedly called for the Commission to collect and use the best data 
available to analyze proposals as we consider changes to our rules and programs.  I’m glad that in this 
item we seek comment on how to revise FCC Form 466 to improve the data we collect.  As we consider 
additional changes to the Rural Health Care Program, we must ensure that our efforts mitigate and 
eliminate unintended consequences.  To that end, I’m glad that commenters have already favorably 
weighed in to support collecting more detailed data.  Only through a methodical and deliberative process 
with roots in accurate data can we ensure that the spirit and goals of the Rural Health Care Program are 
achieved. 
I thank the Chairwoman for her leadership and strongly support this item.  My thanks to the 
dedicated FCC staff for their fantastic work.

 I. INT
RODUCTION  
1. The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline) is a national network of more than 200 
crisis centers that helps thousands of people overcome crisis situations every day.   Dialing “9 -8-8” serves 
as a crucial lifeline for people in need of immediate help.  The ability to call 988 and reach help on a 
timely, consistent basis is of utmost importance to provide support and care to those who may be experiencing a suicidal crisis or mental health -related distress.  On December 1, 2022, however, the 988 
Lifeline  suffered a nationwide  outage that lasted several hours, rendering this vital service inaccessible to 
voice callers.
1  The Department of Health and Human Services announced the outage on Twitter, 
indicating they were “tracking a widespread national system outage at Intrado, a contractor for crisis providers that supports emergency response needs across the country, including the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline…”.
2  The outage left callers reliant on alternative means to contact the hotline, such as text or 
webchat hosted at 988lifeline.org, to which the public were directed by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)
3 once it was 
made aware of the outage.4 
2. To address this serious issue, in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we propose rules 
designed to ensure that the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) and those parties that provide life -saving crisis intervention services to people calling the 988 Lifeline, which includes the 
Veterans Crisis Lifeline, receive timely and actionable information about 988 service outages that 
potentially affect those services’ ability to meet the immediate health needs of people in suicidal crisis 
and mental health distress.  
II. BACKGROUND  
3. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the suicide rate in 
this country increased by 35% from 1999 to 2018 .
5  In 2020, s uicide was a leading cause of death in the 
United States  for people aged 10 to 64  and the second leading cause of death among young people aged 
10 to 24.6  Suicide claimed the lives of nearly 46,000 Americans in 2020, resulting in about one death

very 11 minutes.7  And each year, many more Americans think about or attempt suicide.   For every one 
person who dies by suicide annually, 316 people seriously consider suicide.8 
4. Suicide also disproportionately impacts various at -risk populations.   In 2020, there were 
6,146 Veteran suicides – an average of 16.8 per day – and adjusting for population age and sex 
differences, the suicide rate for Veterans was 57.3% greater than for non -veteran U.S. adults .9  LGBTQ 
youth are “four times more likely to seriously consider suicide, to make a plan for suicide, and to attempt 
suicide versus their peers.”10  A large proportion of youths ages 13-24 have attempted suicide, with the 
proportion particularly high among Native/Indigenous youths or youths who are members of certain 
minorities.  Twelve percent of white youth attempted suicide compared to 31% of Native/Indigenous 
youth, 21% of Black youth, 21% of multiracial youth, 18% of Latinx youth, and 12% of Asian/Pacific Islander youth.
11  The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has found that suicide 
rates in 10 -19 year old Black males has increased by 60% over the past two decades.12  Suicide rates are 
also higher among Native Americans as well as rural Americans.  According to the CDC, American 
Indians/Alaska Natives have the highest rates of suicide of any racial or ethnic group in the United States, and the rates of suicide among this population have been increasing since 2003.
13  And in 2017, the 
suicide rate for the most rural counties in the country was nearly double the rate for the most urban counties.
14  Recent research also highlights that adults with disabilities are more likely to consider suicide.  
For example, a 2021 survey found that adults with disabilities are three times more likely to report 
suicidal ideation in the past month compared to persons without disabilities .15  A 2020 study showed that

5. 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline .  In 2005 , SAMHSA, a public health agency housed in the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,  and Vibrant Emotional Health (Vibrant) a New York -
based mental health non -profit, launched the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline , a 24/7 hotline accessed 
through a toll -free number (1 -800- 273-TALK ).  This hotline, now known as the 988 Suicide & Crisis 
Lifeline and administered by Vibrant (988 Lifeline administrator) under a grant from SAMHSA, is 
“available to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress at any time of the day or night.”17  Since 2005, 
the 988 Lifeline has received over 23 million calls from people in distress looking for support.18 
6. Veterans Crisis Line.  The Veterans Crisis Line is overseen by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) and offers Service Members, Veterans, and their families “supportive, timely, high 
quality crisis intervention services” on a 24/7 basis, nationwide .19  Today c allers can reach the Veterans 
Crisis Line by dialing 988 or by dialing the 988 Lifeline toll -free number and then pressing option 1.20  
Veterans can also access the Veterans Crisis Line via text at 838255 and via online chat by visiting www.veteranscrisisline.net .  T
he Veterans Crisis Line consists of three call centers located in 
Canandaigua, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; and Topeka, Kansas.21  Following completion of a call to the 
Veterans Crisis Line, an electronic consult may be submitted to the Suicide Prevention Coordinator located close to the Veteran, and the Veteran’s local Suicide Prevention Coordinator will respond to this 
consult within 24 business hours.  Since its launch in 2007, the Veterans Crisis Line has answered more 
than 6.4 million calls, and since launching chat services in 2009 and text services in 2011, the Veterans 
Crisis Line has answered more than 772,000 chats and 269,000 texts.

7. 988 Designated as the 3-digit Dialing Code and routing calls .  In 2018, Congress, 
recogniz ing the need to enhance access to SAMHSA’s and the VA’s suicide hotline services, directed the 
Commission, in coordination with SAMHSA and the VA, to analyze the effectiveness of the existing 
Lifeline and examine the feasibility of designating an easy to remember 3-digit dialing code to be used for 
the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system.23  The Commission issued a report 
recommending that designating a 3-digit dialing code solely for the purpose of a national suicide

revention and mental health hotline would likely make it easier for Americans in crisis to access 
potentially life -saving resources and initiated a rulemaking to consider designating 988 as this 3-digit 
code.24  In 2020 Congress amended the Communications Act of 1934 (the Act) to designate  988 as the 
universal telephone number for the national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline system.25  
In response to this Congressional directive, t he Commission adopted rules establishing 9-8- 8 as the 
national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline and required all telecommunications carriers, 
interconnected V oice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers, and one -way VoIP providers to make any 
network changes necessary to ensure that people were able dial 988 to reach the 988 Lifeline by July 16, 2022.
26 
8. In August 2022, the first full month that all providers needed to ensure that people could 
dial 988 to reach the 988 Lifeline, over 256,000 calls were routed to the Lifeline via the 988 code, a 49% increase relative to August 2021
.27  In November 2022, the latest month for which data is available, 
222,285 calls, 72,134 chats, and 52,922 texts (totaling 347,341 contacts) were routed to a 988 Lifeline 
counseling center after the person listened to the greeting (call) or a counselor (chat/text).28  Over 317,900 
interactions resulted in engagements with a counselor for an average contact time of 21 minutes.29  In 
addition, in the same month, 55,457 988 Lifeline calls were offered to the Veterans Crisis Line, for a total 
of 402,798 routed contacts to the 988 Lifeline.30  According to SAMHSA, “the Lifeline works… Almost 
98% of people who call, chat or text the 988 Lifeline get the crisis support they need and do not require additional services in that moment.”
31 
9. Calling the 988 Lifeline .  When someone dials 988, the call is routed by the calling 
party’s originating service provider – such as a wireline, wireless, or VoIP provider – to 1-800 -273- 8255, 
which is the toll free access number for the 988 Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line.32  Once the call is 
received at the 988 Lifeline, the caller encounters an interactive voice response system, where the caller selects routing options.  A caller may press “1” for Veterans Affairs, which routes the call to the Veterans 
Crisis Line, press “2” for Spanish, or stay on the line to be routed to a specialist.  The call is routed to the

removed itself the network, the system automatically routes callers to a backup center.33  Trained 988 
Lifeline  counselors “assess callers for suicidal risk, provide crisis counseling, crisis intervention, engage 
emergency services when necessary, and offer referrals to mental health and/or substance use services.”34  
In addition to taking calls, 30 crisis centers answer online chats on a 24/7 basis.35 
10. Text-to-988.   In November of 2021, the Commission expanded the availability of critical 
mental health and crisis counseling resources by requiring covered text providers36 to allow Americans to 
reach the 988 Lifeline by texting 988.37  The Commission determined that “[t]ext messaging to the 
Lifeline will facilitate access to critical mental health resources for all, and particularly for at-risk 
populations who tend to prefer communicating through text rather than phone calls. ”38  The Commission 
highlighted that “individuals who send text s or online chats to the Lifeline both skew younger and are 
more likely to experienc e current suicidal ideation relative to th e categories of individuals who  typically 
access the 988 Lifeline via phone.”39  The Commission ’s rules require covered text providers to route 
covered 988 text messages to the 988 Lifeline’s current 10 -digit number .40  In May 2022, the Wireline 
Competition Bureau granted a waiver to allow covered text providers to route covered 988 text 
messages41 to the Lifeline using the short code protocol without translation to the Lifeline’s current toll 
free access number, which allows return texts from the Lifeline to appear on consumer devices as coming from 988 rather than 1-800-273-TALK.

11. Outage Reporting and Notification to 911 Special Facilities.  Under Part 4 of the 
Commission’s rules, c able, satellite, wireless, wireline, interconnected VoIP and other  communications 
providers are required to file reports with the Commission when they experience outages to their 
communications services that meet certain magnitude and duration thresholds.43  Providers must notify 
the Commission’s Network Outage Reporting System (NORS) within 120 minutes of discovery of the 
outage, which must include:  the name of the reporting entity; the date and time of onset of the outage; a 
brief description of the problem; service effects; the geographic area affected by the outage; and a contact name and contact telephone number by which the Commission’s technical staff may contact the reporting

contains all pertinent information then available.45  Finally, providers must submit a final report within 30 
days of discovery that contain s all pertinent information on the outage, including any information that was 
not contained in, or that has changed from the information provided in, the initial report.46  The 
Commission monitors the reliability of communications services, including 911 networks , through these 
mandatory outage reporting requirements that, among other things, provide the federal government with 
situational awareness when outages occur, enable statistical analysis of outage trends, and inform 
recommendations to improve network reliability.   This information is also shared with other agencies of 
the federal government, the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Tribal Nations, and the U.S. territories

includes, among other information, the date and time when the incident began, the types of 
communications services affected, the geographic area affected by the outage, how the outage affects the 
911 special facility, the expected date and time of restoration, and the best -known cause of the outage.52  
The adopted rules require providers to notify 911 special facilities by telephone and in writing via electronic means in the absence of another method mutually agreed upon in writing in advance by the 911 special facility and the provider.
53  Providers will be required to transmit initial 911 special facility 
notifications as soon as possible, but no later than 30 minutes after discovering that they have experienced 
an outage that potentially affects a 911 special facility;54 and must communicate additional material 
information to potentially affected 911 special facilities as the information becomes available, but no later than two hours after the initial notification.
55  For outages lasting longer than two hours, service providers 
will need to continue to follow up with additional material information as soon as possible after it becomes available, which continues until the outage is completely repaired and service is fully restored.
56  
Providers must also exercise special diligence to identify , maintain, and, on an annual basis, confirm 
current  contact information appropriate for 911 outage notification for each 911 special facility that serves 
areas that the service provider serves.57  In adopting this obligation, the Commission noted that timely, 
accurate, and actionable information is essential to ensuring that Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) have the means to determine how to engage with the public to best maintain access to emergency services during an outage.

III. DISCUSSION 
A. Reporting 988 Special Facility Outages  
13. The Commission’s rules do not currently require notification when access to the 988 
Lifeline is compromised or the 988 Lifeline system experiences an outage.  To improve the resiliency of 
(Continued from previous page)   
Rulemaking, 36 FCC Rcd 7860 (2021) ( Third Notice ).  We continue to use that term here, but note that the 
communications services that they provide are not limited to call origination.  See 47 CFR § 4.3 (identifying by type 
the various service providers covered by our Part 4 rules); 47 CFR § 4.9 (identifying outage reporting requirements 
by type of service provider).  These providers are subject to our part 4 outage reporting rules including when they 
experience outage in a location other than their call origination networks ( e.g., in “middle mile” or wholesale 
transport network facilities).  
51 The Commission’s rules provide that “[a] n outage that potentially affects a 911 special facility occurs whenever: 
(1) There is a loss of communications to PSAP(s) potentially affecting at least 900,000 user -minutes and: The failure 
is neither at the PSAP(s) nor on the premises of the PSAP(s); no reroute for all end users was available; and the outage lasts 30 minutes or more; or (2) There is a loss of 911 call processing capabilities in one or more E -911 
tandems/selective routers for at least 30 minutes duration;  or (3) One or more end -office or MSC switches or 
host/remote clusters is isolated from 911 service for at least 30 minutes and potentially affects at least 900,000 user -
minutes; or (4) There is a loss of ANI/ALI (associated name and location information) and/or a failure of location 
determination equipment, including Phase II equipment, for at least 30 minutes and potentially affecting at least 900,000 user- minutes (provided that the ANI/ALI or location determination equipment was then currently deployed 
and in use, and the failure is neither at the PSAP(s) or on the premises of the PSAP(s )).”  47 CFR § 4.5(e); see also

 t
he 988 Lifeline system and ensure the Commission, SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline 
administrator have timely outage information so they can provide the public with alternative ways to 
access the 988 Lifeline, we propose to require providers that provide the 988 Lifeline with capabilities 
such as the ability to receive, process, or forward calls to report outages that potentially affect the 988 Lifeline to the Commission’s NORS.  We seek comment on this proposal.  
14. We believe, as in the 911 context, that improving situational awareness of significant 
network outage issues affecting 988 Lifeline services would provide the Commission (as well as other federal, state, Tribal, and territorial agencies with public safety responsibilities) with critical insight into 
the availability and reliability of a vital public health service.  In the short term, we expect that these 
reporting requirements would improve public safety by allowing the Commission and other agencies to assess the magnitude of major outages and, in the long term, to identify network reliability trends and determine whether the outages likely could have been prevented or mitigated had the service providers followed certain network reliability best practices.
59 
15. We seek comment on how we should define the universe of providers that would be 
subject to this new requirement.  We propose to define “covered 988 service providers” as those providers that provide the 988 Lifeline with capabilities such as the ability to receive, process, or forward calls.  Are there additional entities that provide services or functionalities in the 988 call pathway that should be included in the definition of a covered 988 service provider?  Would  the category as drafted be limited 
solely to service providers that have contracted with the 988 Lifeline administrator to provide communications services and functionality in support of 988, or are there other service providers that would fall within the scope of that definition?  If other providers would qualify as “covered 988 service providers” under our proposed definition, we seek comment on the nature of the services they provide and whether the public interest would be served by requiring them to report outages to the Commission.  
16. We propose that 988 outage reports be filed with the Commission in NORS, consistent 
with current outage filing processes.  In this regard, we expect that the use of the NORS database will minimize costs to providers of implementation as providers already file outage reports in NORS, and we expect that the vast majority of outages that potentially affect 988 special facilities are already being reported in this system.  We also propose that covered 988 service providers be required to notify the Commission in this regard when the provider experiences a service outage that results in a loss of the 
ability of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline to receive, process or forward calls for at least 30 minutes. We 
seek comment on this proposal.  Is this time frame too long or too short?  Are there capabilities or call attributes related to 988, such as degradation to calls resulting from processing time outs or connection drops, that the Commission should consider?  
17. In addition to our proposal that covered 988 service providers file outage notifications in 
NORS, we seek comment whether we should require cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and 
interconnected VoIP providers to report outages that potentially affect the 988 Lifeline to the 
Commission’s NORS.  The Commission’s existing rules that require the reporting of outages that potentially affect 911 include as outages triggering reporting obligations those that are associated with more general outages as well as those specific to the emergency number.  We seek comment on whether we should adopt a similar requirement for 988.  If we were to do so, what outage threshold should we 
consider, e.g., outages impacting the toll free access number lasting at least 30 minutes in duration and 
potentially affecting at least 900,000 user minutes?  Should the absence of a reroute be a consideration?  Are there any special characteristics of 988 calls that would make it more effective or efficient for the Commission to adopt alternative outage reporting thresholds that do not resemble the reporting requirements for other communications outages?  If so, what are those differentiating characteristics and how should outage reporting requirements reflect those characteristics?  For example, are there thresholds

No. 15 -80, Second Report and Order, 36 FCC Rcd 6136, 6138, para.6 (2021) (Information Sharing Report and 
Order) (describing how the Commission analyzed NORS outage reports).

 ot
her than outages of 30 minutes in duration or potentially affecting at least 900,000 user -minutes that 
would be more appropriate for reporting on outages to 988 special facilities?  Calls to 988 may require 
lengthier engagements with callers than would a typical 911 call; does this impact the appropriate 
threshold or counsel in favor of an alternative measure?  Will using either the 30 minute outage duration and/or outages potentially affecting 900,000 user minutes result in too many outage reports for SAMHSA, the VA, or the 988 Lifeline administrator to manage and act upon?  Do the differences between 911 call routing and 988 Lifeline call routing affect the policy issues around outage reporting by originating service providers?
60 
18.  We seek comment on whether outages affecting covered 988 texts should be reported, 
and if they should be reported what thresholds should apply and why?  We ask for specific comments addressing the costs associated with requiring reporting of outages to covered 988 text messages.
61 
19. Is there information that is unique to 988 outages that we should require to be included in 
an outage report due to its value in understanding the cause or impacts of such an outage?  Should service 
providers be required to explicitly indicate in their outage reports if an outage potentially affects 988 
special facilities?  Should the required deadlines for the filing of 988 outage reports be different from the deadlines for filing other types of outage reports?  Should the reporting requirements be different for originating service providers that deliver calls to the 988 Lifeline in the first instance versus the covered 988 service provider that handles the call thereafter?  
B. Providing  Notice of Outages That Potentially Affect 988 Special Facilities 
20. We propose to require covered 988 service providers to notify 988 special facilities about 
outages that potentially affect a 988 special facility.  We further propose that this outage notification obligation mirror our existing 911 special facility notification requirements, as discussed below.  We seek comment on our proposal.  Are there any differences between 911 and the 988 Lifeline that would warrant a different approach to 988 special facility notification?  If so, what alternative notification 
requirements should be considered to ensure that 988 special facilities receive effective notifications 
about 988 Lifeline outages?  
21. Notification to 988 special facilities .  We propose to designate SAMHSA, the VA, and 
the 988 Lifeline administrator as 988 special facilities that will receive notifications of outages that potentially affect a 988 special facility.  We believe this approach balances the benefit of allowing 988 
Lifeline officials to take steps to maintain the public’s access to crisis intervention services, while 
minimizing the notification burdens on service providers.  We seek comment on this proposal.  The Commission seeks comment on its belief that timely notice of a 988 Lifeline outage will assist SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator to quickly inform the public of alternative ways of contacting the Lifeline while one type of communication is unavailable, such as texting or using the online chat function if calls are not getting through.  The Commission does not propose to impose any obligations on SAMHSA or the VA.  From what other sources might consumers seek information on a 988 outage? 
22. We propose that r eliance upon a third-party service provider to manage, route, or 
otherwise contribute to 988  call processing would not relieve  covered 988 service provider s of the

2023) (CTIA Ex Parte ). 
61 The Commission notes that in the month of November 2022, the 988 Lifeline routed 52,922 text messages to a 
center and 52,337 texts were connected to a center and then engaged by a counselor, which is 99% of all texts 
received.  In comparison, the 988 Lifeline routed 222,285 calls to a center and 195,083 calls were connected to a 
center and then engaged by a counselor, which is 88% of all calls received.  See SAMHSA Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration, 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, 988 Lifeline Performance Metrics ,

945 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 obl
igation to provide notification to 988 special facilities under these proposed rules.  This is consistent 
with our current treatment of 911 notification obligations.62  We seek comment on this approach.  
23. In addition to our proposal to require notification by covered 988 service providers, we 
seek comment on whether to require cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP 
providers to make similar notifications.  
24. Notification to other entities .  We seek comment on whether there are additional entities 
that should receive notice of an outage that potentially affects a 988 special facility.  For example, should the local crisis centers to which 988 calls are routed be considered 988 special facilities that should 
receive 988 outage notifications?  If notifications are to be made to local crisis centers, should the notice 
be limited to the local crisis center(s) that are directly impacted by the specific 988 outage?  If so, how would providers identify the appropriate local crisis center(s) to notify?  Absent access to local crisis center contact information, how should that information be compiled and maintained?  Should originating service providers experiencing an outage that potentially affects 988 special facilities be required to notify 
the covered 988 service provider of the outage?  Are there steps these centers could take to maintain 
public access to their services that SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator could not take alone?  Should SAMSHA or the 988 Lifeline administrator effectuate or manage notifying the crisis centers of outages?  
25. We seek comment on whether covered 988 service providers should be required to notify 
originating service providers about 988 outages, enabling originating service providers to voluntarily notify their customers of the outage and alternative ways to obtain crisis assistance.
63  Should originating 
service providers be required to provide notice to covered 988 service providers of 988 outages?  Would these notice requirements provide another avenue for consumers to be made aware of 988 service 
outages?  Would these notices provide for increased coordination between the carriers for remedying the 
outage  and coordinating workarounds?  Should PSAPs be notified so they can be prepared for call volume 
increases?  If notice should be required to originating service providers and/or PSAPs, should the content of the notice be the same or different than the notice 988 special facilities receive?  We encourage 
commenters to address the specific costs and benefits of providing notice to these entities.  
26. Content of 988 notification .  In the 911 context , the Commission determined that PSAPs  
should receive consistent, timely, and actionable notice of 911 service outages that potentially affect them 
in order to empower them to lessen the impacts of outages on the provision of emergency services by 
rerouting calls or communicating alternatives to the public.
64  We believe that it is similarly important that 
the information provided during a 988 outage is clear and actionable so that 988 special facilities  can 
make swift judgments as to whether  to inform the public about alternative means to contact mental health 
and suicide prevention services.   As required for 911 outages, we propose that covered 988 service 
providers must provide the following material information in their 988 special facility outage 
notifications:  
• An identifier unique to each outage;  
• The name, telephone number, and email address at which the notifying service provider can 
be reached for follow -up; 
• The name of the service provider(s) experiencing the outage;  
• The date and time when the incident began (including a notation of the relevant time zone);  
 
62 PSAP Notification Order  at para. 13.  
63 But see PSAP Notification Order  at paras. 25 -26 (declining to require originating service providers and covered 
911 service providers to directly notify their customers about 911 outages).  
64 PSAP Notification Order  at para 2.  
946 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 • T
he type of communications service(s) affected;  
• The geographic area affected by the outage;  
• A statement of the notifying service provider’s expectations for how the outage potentially 
affects the 988 special facility ( e.g., dropped calls ); 
• The expected date and time of restoration, including a notation of the relevant time zone;  
• The best -known cause of the outage; and  
• A statement of whether the message is the notifying service provider’s initial notification to 
the 988 special facility, an update to an initial notification, or a message intended to be the 
notifying service provider’s final assessment of the outage. 
We seek comment on this proposal.  Are there differences between 911 and 988 that would warrant 
different content requirements for notifications?  If we were to adopt rules for originating providers in addition to covered 988 service providers, should we require the same content requirements for notifications?  
27. Means of notification.  We propose to require covered 988 service providers to notify 988 
special facilities of outages that potentially affect them by telephone and in writing by electronic means and by alternative means if mutually agreed upon in writing in advance by the 988 special facility and the service provider, which is the same manner of notification that originating service providers follow when notifying 911 special facilities of outages that potentially affect them .
65  We seek comment on our belief 
that dual notification will provide the greatest assurance that a 988 special facility, regardless of its size or capability, will receive the outage notification.  
28. We seek comment on whether there are differences between notifications to 911 special 
facilities and 988 special facilities that warrant a different form of notification.  Should providers have the same formal notification requirements as they do in the 911 setting?  If their notifications should be 
different, why should they differ and what forms of notification should be adopted?  In addition to our 
proposal for covered 988 service providers, should we apply similar requirements to originating cable, 
satellite, wireless, wireline, interconnected VoIP providers?  
29. M
aintain contact information.  To better ensure that potentially affected 988 special 
facilities receive actionable notice about 988 outages, w e propose to require that covered 988 service 
providers exercise special diligence to maintain accurate, up-to -date contact information  for 988 special 
facilities, which includes the name and contact information of the person designated by each of these entities to receive notification of 988 outages.  “Special diligence” is the diligence expected from a person 
practicing in a particular field of specialty under circumstances like those at issue.66  The Commission has 
imposed this higher level of care in circumstances where a failure to take sufficient care can lead to 
particularly serious public harms.67  In these circumstances, “special diligence” would require, for 
example, actively seeking to confirm the accuracy of contact information and not relying on the absence of a response.  Once providers have a 988 special facility contact list in place, special diligence would

equire them to annually verify the accuracy of their contact list to maintain it up -to-date.68  We seek 
comment on this proposal.  In considering whether we should also designate local crisis centers to be 988 
special facilities that are required to receive outage notifications, we seek comment on how providers can 
obtain contact information for these centers.  Does SAMHSA or the 988 Lifeline administrator maintain an updated and accurate list of contacts at each of the counseling centers, and could these contacts also be designated to receive notice of 988 Lifeline outages?  If so, can this list be made available to service providers?  If this list was available, would it mitigate the burdens associated with providing these local crisis centers with notice of 988 outages?  Parties should address the costs that are involved with keeping 
an up to date contact list.  We seek comment on whether we should extend this requirement to originating 
providers, in addition to our proposal for covered 988 service providers.  
30. Timing of initial notification.  We propose that covered 988 service providers be required 
to provide 988 outage notification s to potentially affected 988 special facilities as soon as possible, but no 
later than within 30 minutes of discovering that they have experienced, on any facilities that they own, 
operate, lease, or otherwise utilize,  an outage that potentially affects a 988 special facility.  We believe 
this 30 -minute timeframe is consistent with notifications that are made to 911 special facilities, which we 
have found strikes a balance between the need for timely and actionable 911 outage information and the accuracy of that information.
69  We seek comment on whether this timeframe is appropriate for 988 
outage notification and whether the reporting timeframe should be shortened or extended and if so, why.  
31. Follow -up notification.  We propose that covered 988 service providers communicate 
additional material information, which includes, among other information, the date and time when the incident began, the types of communications services affected, the geographic area affected by the outage, how the outage affects the 988 special facility, the expected date and time of restoration, and the best -
known cause of the outage,  to potentially affected 988 special facilities  in notifications subsequent to the 
initial notification as soon as possible after that information becomes available, but no later than two 
hours after the initial contact.  We propose that for outages lasting longer than two hours,  covered 988 
service providers would be  required to continue to follow up with  additional material information to 988 
special facilities , SAMHSA, the VA, and 988 Lifeline administrator as soon as possible after discovery of 
the new material information , and continue providing additional material information until the outage is 
completely repaired and service is fully restored.  Similar to the follow -up notification requirement for 
911 special facilities, we believe this proposal will produce predictability in notification frequency that  
will significantly assist 9 88 special facilities in analysis and mitigation of network outages.
70  We seek 
comment on this proposal.  We also seek comment on whether we should extend this requirement to 
originating providers.  
32. 988 Lifeline Resiliency and Reliability .  The Commission’s Part 4 rules require covered 
911 service providers to annually file 911 reliability certifications,71 which the Commission has found are 
necessary to ensure the 911 network remains resilient and robust as the use of the 911 network continues to expand.
72  The Commission seeks comment on whether covered 988 service providers should similarly 
be required to file 988 reliability certifications to ensure the network supporting the 988 Lifeline remains resilient and robust.  What should those certifications entail, or to what resiliency actions should those

948 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 cer
tifications attest?  Are there other measures or requirements the Commission could adopt that would 
further improve the resiliency and reliability of the 988 Lifeline?  
33. Legal Authority .  As noted above, in 2020, similar to its prior action with respect to 911, 
Congress further amended Section 251 of the Communications Act of 1934 to specify 988 as the 
universal telephone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.73  Our proposed reporting and 
notice rules are intended to ensure the 988 Lifeline remains operational  in accordance with the policies 
identified by Congress in that 2020 legislation and that any outages are quickly identified and reported, with notice provided to parties who would notify the public of alternative means to access crisis 
counselors, all of which promotes the safety of life and property.  The Commission seeks comment on its 
legal authority to require the 988 outage reporting and 988 special facility notice requirements proposed herein, including its rulemaking authority pursuant to titles II and III of the Communications Act and Section 104 of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act  (CVAA) , as well 
as its authority under Section 4(i) of the Communications Act, as amended, to “perform any and all acts, 
make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders, not inconsistent with this chapter, as may be 
necessary in the execution of its functions"
74 which includes “the purpose of promoting safety of life and 
property….”75. 
C. Assessing  the Benefits and Costs  
34. We seek comment on the potential benefits  and costs of the proposals addressed in this 
Notice.  The 988 Lifeline directly benefits people in crisis and saves lives.  When the 988 Lifeline is 
interrupted, people’s lives are put into jeopardy.  In November 2022, the 988 Lifeline answered 195,083 calls, which is an average of over 6,500 answered calls per day.
76  We believe our proposed outage 
reporting requirements would improve public safety by providing the Commission and other impacted entities with situational awareness of 988 outages, including the magnitude and causes of those outages, and allow for  the identification of  network reliability trends that can help identify best practices that could 
improve network reliability by helping to mitigate future outages.  Our proposed notice and contact information retention requirements are intended to ensure that when 988 calling is disrupted, parties responsible for the varying aspects of the 988 call pathway notify 988 special facilities, share critical 
information in a timely and standardized  manner, and are motivated to hasten the timely restoration of 
988 Lifeline services.  We describe below how even a very small increase in the speed of restoration of 
access to 988 Lifeline services could provide benefits that outweigh the costs of adopting the proposed 
requirements.  
 
73 See National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020, Pub. L. No. 116 -172, 134 Stat. 832 § 3 (2020) (adding 
subsection (e)(4) to section 251 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended).  
74 47 U.S.C. § 154(j).  
75 47 U.S.C. § 151. In the Text to 988 Order , 36 FCC Rcd 16901 para. 55 (2021), the Commission relied on Title III 
to impose text- to-988 rules for CMRS providers and the CVAA to adopt text -to-988 rules for interconnected text 
messaging services.   In that decision, the Commission noted that although the CVAA does not define “emergency 
network” or “emergency services,” Congress had deemed crisis lines “essential” and recognized the need for a 3-
digit phone number for such services; thus the Commission found that it was “reasonable to conclude that [988] 
services should be considered ‘emergency services’ and that the Lifeline and Veterans Crisis Line act as an ‘emergency network’ within the meaning of the CVAA.”   The Commission further found that texting capabilities 
provide “easy access to emergency services for people with disabilities,” noting that such individuals “may not be able to take advantage of 988’s voice service, necessitating that an alternative means of communicating be provided,” and “therefore conclud[ing] that the CVAA provides authority for the rules” governing text -to-988.

2022).  
949 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 35. T
he benefits of reducing suicide via 988 are driven by suicides’ staggering societal costs.  
In 2020, there were 45,979 deaths by suicide in the United States, which, as noted above, averages out to 
almost one death every 11 minutes.77  For every suicide death, there were 4 hospitalizations for suicide 
attempts, 8 suicide -related emergency department visits, and 27 self -reported suicide attempts.78  In 
addition to lives saved, time saving network outage protocols will also alleviate the devastating emotional 
toll wrought by suicide on victims’ families, friends, and communities. 
36. Notifying SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator of the disruption of 
access to 988 Lifeline services should allow these parties to manage the impact of outages on their 
operations, quickly notify the public of the 988 service outage, and promote alternative ways for people to 
access 988 Lifeline services while 988 Lifeline service is out, which may include notifying the public of alternative call numbers, or encouraging people to text to 988 or use the https://988lifeline.org/  lin
k to 
chat with a crisis management counselor.  This , in turn , should enhance the 988 Lifeline’s ability to direct 
scarce resources toward mitigating outages rather than seeking out information to whether an outage is 
occu rring, the scope of such an outage or its impact .  The Commission can turn its attention to 
administering  the 988 rules and the providers to fulfill ing their service obligations.  One of the benefits of 
implementing short dialing for calls to the Lifeline was to reduce the burdens on 911 and other emergency 
services arising from calls related to mental health and suicide.  We believe that our proposed rules will further reduce the burden on 911 and other emergency services by promoting 988 reliability so that 988 
calls go through when callers need 988 service the most.
79  We seek comment on the benefits associated 
with our proposed rules and whether these requirements will help  to preserve the public’s continuity of 
access to  the 988 special facilities that support them.  Are there any other benefits to public health and 
safety that arise from our proposed rules that we have not described? 
37. We also seek comment on the  burdens associated with the proposed rules.  To the extent 
that there are 988 outages that are not currently reported to the Commission, we expect that those would be outages experienced by covered 988 service providers that are responsible for receiv ing, processing, or 
forward ing 988 calls.  We expect that these service providers are already submitting outage reports to the 
Commission related to other aspects of their operations, so initial compliance costs would be negligible.  
Assuming that one covered 988 service provider experiences a maximum of one reportable outage per month, we estimate an annual compliance cost for that one covered 988 service provider of $1,000 .

79 In the Commission’s proceeding designating 988 as the 3 -digit dialing code for the Lifeline, the North American 
Numbering Council (NANC) issued a report considering each existing N11 code, and while the Commission 
determined designating a unique 3- digit code was superior to using an existing code, NANC determined that 
“[a]llowing 211 operators to act as a first line of defense in suicide prevention calls might alleviate the pressure on 911 call takers and allow the caller to obtain assistance for other non -suicide related services in addition to mental

Docket No. 92 -105, at 7 (May 10, 2019) (NANC Report).
 
80 We estimate a maximum of two hours total time would be necessary to submit all of the required reports to the 
Commission.  We estimate that each notification would take 15 minutes to complete, each initial report would take a maximum of 45 minutes to complete, and each final report would take a maximum of one hour to complete.  We 
assume a labor cost of $ 43 per  hour for a miscellaneous media and communication worker who would likely be the 
type of employee responsible for preparing and submitting outage reports.  Our total cost estimate=$43/hr x  2 hrs x 
one reportable outage per month x 12 months = $1,032, rounded to $1,000.  
We use the job category of “Miscellaneous Media and Communication Worker” in this estimate.  See Economic 
News Release, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National employment and wage data from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey by occupation, May 2021 (May 2021) https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.t01.htm .  We

 a co
nsequence, we expect the actual cost for implementation and compliance of the proposed outage 
reporting rules will be  extremely low .  We seek comment on our analysis.  
38. With regard to the proposed requirements to maintain updated contact information for 
988 special facilities and to notify those facilities about outages that affect them, we expect that the costs 
of compliance will also be relatively low when compared to the benefits to the public.   We estimate a one-
time industry-wide cost of $56,000 to create an e- mail survey to biannually solicit 988 special facility 
contact information .81  We do not expect any costs arising from the creation or updating of outage 
notification templates, as the 988 outage notification requirements that we propose today share the same 
content and timing as the 911 outage notification requirements with which service providers already 
comply.  We estimate maximum annually recurring costs of $1,354,000, which consist of $1,326,000 for notifying 988 special facilities of outages that potentially affect them pursuant to the standards that we propose today
82 and $28,000 for  soliciting appropriate contact information for  outage notification from 
(Continued from previous page)   
begin with the average hourly wage [$28.68] and  multiply by 1.5 to account for benefits [$43.02 ] then round down 
to $43.  According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits (including paid leave, supplementary pay, insurance, 
retirement and savings, and legally required benefits) add approximately 50% to compensation in the information 
industry as a whole.  See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic News Release, Table 4.  Private industry workers by 
occupational and industry group, Information Industry (September 2022).  
81 To create an e -mail survey, we estimate that for each of 3,124 providers, one worker earning $36/hour would 
spend ½ hour for a total of $56,000 [$36/hour  x ½ hour x 3,124 = 56,232, rounded down to $5 6,000].  See, e.g., 
Anthony Smith, How to Create a Survey in Outlook , https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how -t o-create-a- survey -in-

We use the job category of “Communications Equipment Operators, All Other” in this and other estimates, to avoid 
under -estimating labor costs for tasks that are likely performed by lower -paid workers.  See Economic News 
Release, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National employment and wage data from the Occupational Employment 
Statistics survey by occupation, May 2021  (May 20 21) https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.t01.htm .  We 
begin with the average hourly wage [$23.79] and multiply by 1.5 to account for benefits [$35.69]  then round up to 
$36.  According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits (including paid leave, supplementary pay, insurance, 
retirement and savings, and legally required benefits) add approximately 50% to compensation in the information 
industry as a whole.  See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic News Release, Private industry workers by 
occupational and industry group ( 2021 ). 
We estimate that there are 3, 124 cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and interconnected VoIP providers in the United 
States.  This consists of four satellite providers, 947 wireline providers, 423 wireless providers, and 1,750  
interconnected VoIP -related entities.  Our satellite figure consists only of those service providers that offer service 
that could potentially affect 911.  See generally, Revision of the Commission’s Rules to Ensure Compatibility with 
Enhanced 911 Emergency Calling Systems , CC Docket No. 94 -102 (including five satellite providers’ 911 Post -
Implementation Status Report filings in the Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System regarding the deployment of 911 call center service and the forwarding of 911 calls to PSAPs).  Our wireless figure is calculated based on staff analysis of 2022  Form 499 -A data, consisting of holding companies and affiliated entities who report 
end-user mobile telecommunication revenue.  Our wireline and interconnected VoIP -related figures are sourced 
from the June 2021 Voice Telephone Services Report .  See also FCC,  Voice Telephone Services Report, 
https://www.fcc.gov/voice -telephone -services -report  (
last visited Dec. 22 , 2022 ).  Because cable providers generally 
rely on either (wireline) switched access or interconnected VoIP to provide 988 -related services, these providers are 
already subsumed by our other estimates.  
82 To notify 988 special facilities , we propose that a communications equipment operator, earning $34/hour, would 
spend a total of 1 hour per outage to send out two  notifications for each of an estimated 39,000 outages , for a total of  
$1,326,000  [$34/hour  x 1 hour x 39,000].   Our estimate of 39,000  outages is based on the incidence of outages that 
potentially affected 911 in NORS reports during 2021.   We assume that the maximum number of 988 outages that 
would require notifications annually will not exceed the number of 911 outages. We expect that our estimate of the cost will reduce significantly over time as the Commission collects better data on the actual number of 988 outages experienced annually.

88 special facilities.83  We expect that no costs will be incurred related to  identifying the 988 special 
facilities  that could potentially be affected by a n outage, as we have proposed that the same three special 
facilities (SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator) be notified regardless of the geographic 
area affected by the outage. 
39. We seek comment on this analysis.  How many outages that potentially affect 988 special 
facilities are estimated to be occurring annually that would be subject to the notification requirements that we propose today, and what is the basis for that estimate?  In the event that we were to designate local crisis centers as 988 special facilities, we seek comment on the costs related to the notification of those 
facilities.  Are there steps that can be taken to minimize those costs, such as SAMHSA or the 988 Lifeline 
administrator agreeing to regularly share updated lists of designated contacts directly with service providers so the local crisis centers do not need to be contacted individually?  To what extent have service providers already implemented a notification framework for 911 or other services that would reduce any costs associated with our proposal?  We seek comment on the extent to which service providers have set 
up automated triggers for other forms of notifications, whether they may be able to leverage automatic 
triggers they may already have in place for PSAP notifications, and what costs would be involved.  
40.  We seek comment on additional benefits and costs as well as alternative quantifications 
of benefits and costs from our proposed rules.  We recognize that it is difficult to quantify the value of continuity of access to 988 service, which includes its capacity to save lives and mitigate and prevent 
injuries.  However, we believe the considerable public safety value of the proposals adopted today as 
described above will exceed the limited costs of implementation.  We seek comment on our assessment.  We encourage commenters to quantify both specific costs and benefits that would result from adoption of the proposed notice and reporting requirements.  
D. Promoting Digital Equity  
41. The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to advance digital equity for all,
84 
including people of color, persons with disabilities, persons who live in rural or Tribal areas, and others who are or have been historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality, invites comment on any equity-related considerations
85 and benefits (if any) that may be 
associated with the proposals and issues discussed herein.  Specifically, we seek comment on how our proposals may promote or inhibit advances in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, as well  as the 
scope of the Commission’s relevant legal authority.  
 
83 To transmit an e -mail survey, we estimate that for each of the 3,124 affected carriers, one worker, earning 
$36/hour, would spend at most 15 minutes each year to e -mail the survey of contact information to the three 988 
special facilities, and to follow up with those special facilities if needed, for a total of $25,000 [$36/hour x 0.25 
hours x 3,124 = $28,116, rounded down to $28,000]. 
84 Section 1 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended provides that the FCC “regulat[es] interstate and 
foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make [such service] available, so far as possible, to 
all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex.”  47 U.S.C. § 151.  
85 The term “equity” is used here consistent with Executive Order 13985 as the consistent and systematic fair, just, 
and impartial treatment of all individuals, including individuals who belong to underserved communities that have 
been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons 
otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.  See  Exec. Order No. 13985, 86 Fed. Reg. 7009, 
Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal 
Government (Jan . 20, 2021).  
952 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 E. T
imelines for Compliance  
42. We propose to set a compliance date for these proposed rules at the later of (1) 30 days 
after the Commission issues a Public Notice announcing that OMB has completed review of any new 
information collection requirements associated with the adopted Report and Order; or (2) 90 days after the publication of final rules in the Federal Register.  We believe that the revisions proposed today constitute only minor changes to existing procedures and it will take a modest amount of time for covered 988 service providers to adjust their processes to meet the proposed rules because, as noted above, the proposed requirements are closely aligned with the notice and reporting requirements for 911 network 
outages.  We seek comment on this assessment.  We also seek comment on whether allowing additional 
time for small - and medium -sized businesses to comply with the requirements we propose today would 
serve the public interest.  
IV. PROCEDURAL MATTERS  
43. Paperwork Reduction Act.   This document contains proposed new and modified 
information collection requirements.  The Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, invites the general public and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to comment on the information collection requirements contained in this document, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13.  In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4), we seek specific 
comment on how we might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns 
with fewer than 25 employees.  
44. Ex Parte Rules - Permit -But-Disclose.  This proceeding shall be treated as a “permit-but -
disclose” proceeding in accordance with the Commission’s ex parte rules.
86  Persons making ex parte 
presentations must file a copy of any written presentation or a memorandum summarizing any oral presentation within two business days after the presentation (unless a different deadline applicable to the 
Sunshine period applies).  Persons making oral ex parte presentations are reminded that memoranda 
summarizing the presentation must (1) list all persons attending or otherwise participating in the meeting at which the ex parte presentation was made, and (2) summarize all data presented and arguments made during the presentation.  If the presentation consisted in whole or in part of the presentation of data or arguments already reflected in the presenter’s written comments, memoranda or other filings in the 
proceeding, the presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, 
memoranda, or other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or arguments can be found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum.  Documents shown or given to Commission staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte presentations and must 
be filed consistent with Rule 1.1206(b).  In proceedings governed by Rule 1.49(f) or for which the Commission has made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and 
memoranda summarizing oral ex parte presentations, and all attachments thereto, must be filed through 
the electronic comment filing system available for that proceeding, and must be filed in their native format (e.g., .doc, .xml, .ppt, searchable .pdf).  Participants in this proceeding should familiarize themselves with the Commission’s ex parte rules.  
45. Regulatory Flexibility Act.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),
87 
requires that an agency prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for notice and comment rulemakings, unless the agency certifies that “the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.”
88  Accordingly, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory 
 
86 47 CFR §§ 1.1200 et seq.  
87 See 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601 –612, was amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104 -121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996) .

958 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7 
APPENDIX B  
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities by the policies and rules proposed in the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice ).  Written public comments are requested on this IRFA.  
Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for comments 
on the Notice .  The Commission will send a copy of the Notice , including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel 
for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).2  In addition, the Notice and IRFA (or 
summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal Register.3 
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules  
2. In this proceeding, the Commission takes steps to improve the reliability and resiliency of 
telecommunications networks nationwide and 988 Lifeline network specifically , so that the American 
public can continue to reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (988 Lifeline)  without undue delay or 
disruption.  T he Notice seeks comment on 988 Lifeline outage reporting and notification requirements 
that are similar to the Commission’s rules for reporting 911 outages that would be applicable to originating service pr oviders
4 and proposes outage reporting and notification requirements for a new 
category of “covered 988 service providers.”  The new “covered 988 service providers” category would 
be defined as those providers that provide the 988 Lifeline with capabilities such as the ability to receive, 
process, or forward calls.  Both the originating service providers and the covered 988 service providers  
would be require d to file  988 outage reports with the Commission, in the Commission’s Network Outage 
Reporting System (NORS).  
3. The Notice seeks comment on whether cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, and 
interconnected VoIP  providers should be required to notify 988 special facilities about outages that affect 
these facilities pursuant to notification obligations that mirror the Commission's existing 911 special 
facility notification requirements.  T he Notice  seeks comment on the appropriate threshold to trigger 
reporting, including whether it should include outages potentially affecting at least 900,000  user-minutes 
and/or the outage lasts 30 minutes or more, or whether the absence of a call reroute should be a factor.  For covered 988 service providers, the Notice proposes to require these providers notify the Commission 
of outages resulting in a loss of the ability of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline to receive, process,  or 
forward calls for at least 30 minutes in duration .
5  The Notice  also proposes to designate the Department 
of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the 988 Lifeline administrator as the 988 
special facilities that must be notified of an outage that potentially affects a 988 facility. 
4. Additionally, for covered 988 service providers the Notice proposes that the 988 outage 
notification to 988 special facilities include specific content requirements, the means by which 
notification must be made, the timing to file the initial and follow -up notice, and the filing of an annual 
verification that a provider’s information for 988 special facilities is up to date.  Further, in the Notice  we 
set a proposed compliance deadline of the later of 30 days after the Commission issues a Public Notice 
 
1 See 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 601 -12, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104 -121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996).  
2 See 5 U.S.C. § 603(a).  
3 Id. 
4 The reporting requirements would be applicable to c able, satellite, wireless, wireline , and interconnected VoIP 
providers (jointly referred to as “originating service providers”).  
5 A service provider would remain directly responsible to provide the 988 special facilities notification even where it 
relies on a third -party service provider to manage, route, or otherwise contribute to 9 88 call processing . 
959 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 
 an
nouncing that OMB has completed review of any new information collection requirements associated 
with the final rules adopted in a Report and Order; or (2) 90 days after the publication of final rules in the 
Federal Register.  We seek comment on all of the proposals we make in the Notice , and on the benefits 
and costs analyses we discuss for the proposals.  We also seek comment on applying similar provisions to originating service providers as to notice parameters and implementation timeframes.  
5. The Commission believes the significant public safety benefits which include the 
capacity to save lives, mitigate, and prevent injuries furthers the public interest and outweighs the implementation costs for service providers if the proposed rules are adopted.  Since the 988 outage 
notification requirements proposed in the Notice  are closely aligned with the existing notice and reporting 
requirements for 911 network outages, we also believe implementation by cable, satellite, wireless, 
wireline, interconnected VoIP, and covered 988 service providers will only require minor changes to existing processes and procedures.  
B. Legal Basis 
6. The proposed action is authorized pursuant S ections  1, 4(i), 4(j), 4(n), 201(b), 214, 218, 
251(e)(3), 251(e)(4), 301, 303(b), 303(g), 303(r), 307, 309(a), 332, and 403, of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and sections 3(b) and 6 of the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i), 154(j) 154(n), 201(b), 214, 218, 251(e)(3), 251(e)(4), 301, 303(b), 303(g), 303(r), 307, 309(a), 332, 403, 615, 615a -1, the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act 
of 2018, Pub. L. No. 115 -233, 132 Stat. 2424 (2018) , and the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 
2020, Pub. L. No. 116- 271 (2020) . 
C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed Rules Will Apply  
7. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.
6  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”7  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.”8  A “small business 
concern” is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.9 
8. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, and Small Governmental Jurisdictions .  Our 
actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, at the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein.
10  
First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.  These types of small businesses represent 
99.9% of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 3 2.5 million businesses.
11 
 
6 5 U.S.C. § 603(b)(3).  
7 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).  
8 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small -business concern” in the Small Business 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

t, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not -
for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”12  The 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual 
electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations.13  Nationwide, for tax year 20 20, there 
were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less 
according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.14 
10. Finally, the  small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined 
generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”
15  U.S. Census Bureau data from the 201 7 Census 
of Governments16 indicate there were 90,075 l ocal governmental jurisdictions consisting of general  
purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States.17  Of this number , there were 
36,931 g eneral purpose governments (county ,18 municipal , and town or township19) with populations of 
less than 50,000 and 12,040  special p urpose governments —independent school districts20 with enrollment 
 
12 See 5 U.S.C.  § 601(4).  
13 The IRS benchmark is similar to the population of less than 50,000 benchmark in 5 U.S.C § 601(5) that is used to 
define a small governmental jurisdiction .  Therefore, the IRS benchmark has been used to estimate the number small 
organizations in this small entity description.   See Annual Electronic Filing Requirement for Small Exempt 
Organizations – Form 990 -N (e-Postcard), “Who must file,” https://www.irs.gov/charities -non-pr ofits/annual -

does not provide information on whether a small exempt organization is independently owned and operated or 
dominant in its field .

 popul
ations of less than 50,000.21  Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data , we 
estimate that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of “small governmental jurisdiction s.”22 
11. C able and Other Subscription Programming.  The U.S. Census Bureau defines this 
industry as  establishments primarily engaged in operating studios and facilities for the broadcasting of 
programs on a subscription or fee basis.23  The broadcast programming is typically narrowcast in nature 
(e.g., limited format, such as news, sports, education, or youth -oriented).  These establishments produce 
programming in their own facilities or acquire programming from external sources.24 The programming 
material is usually delivered to a third party, such as cable systems or direct-to -home satellite systems, for 
transmission to viewers.25  The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies firms with 
annual receipts less than $41.5 million as small.26  Based on U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017, 378 firms 
operated in this industry during that year.27  Of that number, 149 firms operated with revenue of less than 
$25 million a year and 44 firms operated with revenue of $25 million or more.28  Based on this data, the 
Commission estimates that a majority of firms in this industry are small.  
12. C able Companies and Systems (Rate Regulation).   The Commission has developed its 
own small business size standard for the purpose of cable rate regulation.  Under the Commission’s rules, 
a “small cable company” is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers nationwide.29  Based on industry 
data, there are about 420  cable companies in the U.S.30  Of these, only seven have more than 400,000 
subscribers.31  In addition, under the Commission’s rules, a “small system” is a cable system serving 
 
21 While the special purpose governments category also includes local special district governments, the 2017 Census 
of Governments data does not provide data aggregated based on population size for the special purpose governments 
category.  Therefore, only data from independent school districts is included in the special purpose governments category.  
22 This total is derived from the sum of the number of general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or 
township) with populations of less than 50,000 (36,931) and the number of special purpose governments - 
independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000 (12,040), from the 2017 Census of Governments - Organizations tbls.5, 6 & 10.

avoid disclosing data for individual companies (see Cell Notes for this category).  
28 Id.  The available U.S. Census Bureau data does not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that 
meet the SBA size standard. We note that the U.S. Census Bureau withheld publication of the number of firms that 
operated with sales/value of shipments/revenue in all categories of revenue less than $500,000 to avoid disclosing 
data for individual companies (see Cell Notes for the sales/value of shipments/revenue in these categories).  Therefore, the number of firms with revenue that meet the SBA size standard would be higher than noted herein.  
We also note that according to the U.S. Census Bureau glossary, the terms receipts and revenues are used

000 or fewer subscribers.32  Based on industry data, there are about 4,139 cable systems (headends) in 
the U.S.33  Of these, about 639 have more than 15,000 subscribers.34  Accordingly, the Commission 
estimates that the majority of cable companies and cable systems are small.  
13. Cable System Operators (Telecom Act Standard) .  The Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended, contains a size standard for a “small cable operator,” which is “a cable operator that, directly or 
through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than one percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.”
35  For purposes of the Telecom Act Standard, the Commission determined that a cable 
system operator that serves fewer than 677,000 subscribers, either directly or through affiliates, will meet the definition of a small cable operator based on the cable subscriber count established in a 2001 Public Notice.
36  Based on industry  data, only six cable system operators have more than 677,000 subscribers.37  
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the majority of cable system operators are small under this size standard.  We note however, that the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 
million.
38  Therefore, we are unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of cable 
system operators that would qualify as small cable operators under the definition in the Communications 
Act. 
14. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers.   Neither the Commission nor the SBA have 
developed a small business size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange carriers.  Wired 
Telecommunications Carriers39 is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard.40  The 
SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 1,500 
or fewer employees as small.41  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms in this

36 FCC Announces New Subscriber Count for the Definition of Small Cable Operator, Public Notice, 16 FCC Rcd 
2225 (CSB 2001) ( 2001 Subscriber Count PN ).  In this Public Notice, the Commission determined that there were 
approximately  67.7 million cable subscribers in the United States at that time using the most reliable source publicly 
available .  Id.  We recognize that the number of cable subscribers changed since then and that the Commission has 
recently estimated the number of cable subscribers to traditional and telco cable operators to be approximately 58.1 
million.  See Communications Marketplace Report , GN Docket No. 20 -60, 2020 Communications Marketplace 
Report, 36 FCC Rcd 2945 , 3049, para. 156  (2020) ( 2020 Communications Marketplace Report ).  However, because 
the Commission has not issued a public notice subsequent to the 2001 Subscriber Count PN,  the Commission still 
relies on the subscriber count threshold established by the 2001 Subscriber Count PN  for purposes of this rule .  See 
47 CFR § 76.901( e)(1).

38 The Commission does receive such information on a case -by-case basis if a cable operator appeals a local 
franchise authority’s finding that the operator does not qualify as a small cable operator pursuant to § 76.901( e) of 
the Commission’s rules.  See 47 CFR §  76.910 (b).

as of December 31, 2020, there were 1,227 providers that reported they were incumbent local exchange 
service providers.44  Of these providers,  the Commission estimates that 9 29 providers have 1,500 or fewer

the majority of incumbent local exchange carriers can be considered small entities.  
15. Local Exchange Carriers. (LECs).   Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to local exchange services. Providers of these 
services include both incumbent and competitive local exchange service providers.   Wired 
Telecommunications Carriers46 is the closest industry with an SBA small business size standard.47  Wired 
Telecommunications Carriers are also referred to as wireline carriers or fixed local service providers.48  
The SBA small business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers classifies firms having 
1,500 or fewer employees as small.49  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 3,054 firms 
that operated in this industry for the entire year.50  Of this number, 2,964 firms operated with fewer than 
250 employees.51  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring 
Report, as of December 31, 2020, there were 5,183 providers that reported they were fixed local exchange service providers.
52  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 4,737 providers have 1,500 or 
fewer employees.53  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these providers 
can be considered small entities.

ll Other Telecommunications.   This  industry is comprised of establishments primarily 
engaged in providing specialized telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications 
telemetry, and radar station operation.54  This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in 
providing satellite terminal stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.
55  Providers of Internet services (e.g. dial-up ISPs) or voice over Internet protocol 
(VoIP) services, via client -supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.56  
The SBA small business size standard for  this industry  classifies firms with annual receipts of $3 5 million 
or less as small .57  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that there were 1,079 firms in this industry that 
operated for the entire year.58  Of those firms, 1,039 had revenue of less than $25 million.59  Based on this 
data, the Commission estimates that the majority of “ All Other Telecommunications” firms can be 
considered small. 
17. Satellite Telecommunications.  This industry comprises firms “primarily engaged in 
providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or 
reselling satellite telecommunications.”60  Satellite telecommunications service providers include satellite 
and earth station operators.   The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business 
with $38.5 million or less in annual receipts  as small .61  U.S. Census Bureau data for 201 7 show that 275  
firms in this industry operated for the entire year.62  Of this number , 242 firms had revenue of less than

establishments engaged in purchasing access and network capacity from owners and operators of 
telecommunications networks and reselling wired and wireless telecommunications services (except satellite) to businesses and households.
66  Establishments in this industry resell telecommunications; they 
do not operate transmission facilities and infrastructure.67  Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) are 
included in this industry.68  The SBA small business size standard for this industry classifies a business as 
small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.69  U.S. Census Bureau data for 2017 show that 1,386 firms 
operated in this industry for the entire year.70  Of that number, 1,375 firms operated with fewer than 250 
employees.71  Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2021 Universal Service Monitoring Report , 
as of December 31, 2020, there were 811 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of local or toll resale services.
72  Of these providers, the Commission estimates that 784 providers have 
1,500 or fewer employees.73  Consequently, using the SBA’s small business size standard, most of these 
providers can be considered small entities. 
19. Wired Telecommunications Carriers.   The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as 
“establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and 
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission  of voice, data, text, sound, and video using 
wired telecommunications networks. 74  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a 
combination of technologies.  Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including VoIP services, wired (cable) audio and video programming distribution, and wired broadband internet services.

CS involve eligibility for bidding credits and installment payments in the auction of licenses for the 
various frequency bands included in WCS.  When bidding credits are adopted for the auction of licenses 
in WCS frequency bands, such credits may be available to several types of small businesses based 
average gross revenues (small, very small and entrepreneur) pursuant to the competitive bidding rules 
adopted in conjunction with the requirements for the auction and/or as identified in the designated entiti es 
section in Part 27 of the Commission’s rules for the specific WCS frequency bands.88 
22. In frequency bands where licenses were subject to auction, the Commission notes that as 
a general matter, the number of winning bidders that qualify as small businesses at the close of an auction 
does not necessarily represent the number of small businesses currently in service.  Further, the 
Commission does not generally track subsequent business size unless, in the context of assignments or transfers, unjust enrichment issues are implicated.  Additionally, since the Commission does not collect data on the number of employees for licensees providing these services, at this time we are not able to estimate the number of licensees with active licenses that would qualify as small under the SBA’s small business size standard.

ecial facilities about outages that potentially affect 988 special facilities.  These service providers would 
be required to:  (1) report outages that potentially affect 988 special facilities using NORS, and following 
processes and procedures similar to the Commission’s existing reporting for outages that potentially 
affect 911; (2) submit notifications, initial reports, and final reports to the Commission consistent with the 
timing and content requirements proposed in the Notice , when they experience an outage that potentially 
affects a 988 special facility; (3) provide notice of 988 outages that potentially affect a 988 special facility to the designated 988 special facilities, including SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator; and (4) make an annual filing verifying that they are maintaining up-to-date contact information for 988 
special facilities.  The Notice seeks comment on similar obligations for cable, satellite, wireless, wireline, 
and interconnected VoIP providers.  
27. The Commission is not currently in a position to determine whether, if adopted, the 
proposed rules in the Notice  will require small entities to hire attorneys, engineers, consultants, or other 
professionals to comply.  We note, however, that some originating service providers and covered 988 service providers are already subject to compliance with outage reporting obligations that would facilitate 
their ability to comply, and may reduce any compliance burdens associated with the proposed 988 outage 
reporting and notification requirements, if adopted.  For example, some originating service providers and covered 988 service providers already must comply with the Commission’s rules on network outage reporting and 911 outage reporting.  In addition, many service providers are likely to already have documented procedures for notifying affected facilities of outages that potentially affect them, and for 
those that do not, Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) Network Reliability 
Steering Committee (NRSC) Task Force documents can serve as a useful guide.  
28. As discussed in the Notice , we anticipate that originating service providers are already 
required to report the vast majority of outages (if not virtually all outages) that prevent 988 calls from successfully completing to the Commission under our existing outage reporting requirements.  Therefore we expected small entities who are subject to these requirements will only incur incremental costs to 
implement the proposed 988 outage reporting requirements.  To the extent that there are 988 outages that 
are not currently reported to the Commission, we expect that those would be outages experienced by covered 988 service providers that are responsible for receiving, processing, or forwarding 988 calls.  We expect that these service providers are already submitting outage reports to the Commission related to other aspects of their operations, and anticipate that these providers will likewise only incur incremental costs to comply with the proposed 988 requirements.  
29. In the assessment of the potential costs for service providers to report 988 outages to the 
Commission discussed in the Notice , we assum e that one covered 988 service provider experiences a 
maximum of one reportable outage per month.  We estimate an annual compliance cost of $1,920 for a provider that experiences a reportable outage based on the  estimate that a maximum of two hours total 
time would be necessary for an employee to prepare and submit all of the required reports to the 
Commission - 15 minutes to complete each notification, a maximum of 45 minutes for each ini tial report, 
60 minutes for each final report, and a labor cost of $80 per hour for  one employee .  Based on this 
assessment.  W e do not expect the actual cost for implementation and compliance with the proposed 
outage reporting rules for small entities to be significant, however we have requested comments on our 
estimates and assessment.  With regard to the proposed requirements for providers to maintain updated 
contact information for 988 s pecial facilities and to notify those facilities about 988 outages that 
potentially affect them, we expect the costs of compliance for providers will also be very low  and should 
not be significant for small entities.  More specifically, we estimate a one-time total cost of $ 50,000 for 
all providers to create an e- mail survey to biannually solicit 988 special facility contact information .  We 
further estimate maximum annually recurring costs of $1,283,000, for all providers, consisting of 
$1,258,000 for notifying 988 special facilities of outages pursuant to the standards that we propose 
970 Federal Communications Commission  FCC 23 -7  
 
 t
oday108 and $ 25,000 to maintain up to date 988 special facility contact information for outage 
notifications.109  No costs should be incurred related to identifying the 988 special facilities that could 
potentially be affected by an outage  since we have proposed that the three designated special facilities 
(SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator) be notified regardless of the geographic area 
affected by the outage.  
30. Based  on the above discussion, we do not believe that the costs associated with any of the 
proposal rule changes in the Notice  will unduly burden small entities.  However, we have sought 
comments from the parties in the proceeding and requested cost and benefit information which may help 
the Commission identify and evaluate relevant costs and other matters for small entities.  We anticipate 
the proposed rule changes will enable 988 special facilities to accelerate the public’s ability to reach the 988 Lifeline during an outage, thereby reducing the probability of lives being lost during such an outage.  Moreover, the value of this result and the other public safety benefits generated by our 988 outage notification and reporting requirement proposals outweigh the estimated costs to providers, and therefore is in the public. 
E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities and Significant Alternatives Considered  
31. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant, specifically small business, 
alternatives that it has considered in reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others):  “(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting 
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small entities; (2) the 
clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities;  (3) the use of performance rather than design standards; and (4) an exemption from 
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small entities.”
110 
32. In the Notice , the Commission continues to facilitate the reliability of the 988 Lifeline 
network and meet its public safety obligations for oversight of the integrity of the 988 communications 
infrastructure by proposing measures to ensure that 988 special facilities can expect consistent and timely 
outage notifications whenever there is an outage that potentially affects 988 Lifeline service.  While doing so, the Commission is mindful that small entities and other covered 988 service providers may incur costs should the proposals we make, and the alternatives upon which we seek comment in the Notice , be 
adopted.  
33. The Commission has taken several steps that could reduce the economic impact for small 
entities.  First, the elements for 988 outage reporting that we propose largely track the same standards applicable to 911 outage reporting.  For example, the Notice proposes to use NORS for 988 outage 
reporting, which is already used for 911 outage reporting   The Notice also seeks comment on using  the 
911 outage duration and user minute thresholds to trigger the 988 outage reporting requirements.  
 
108 To notify 988 special facilities, we propose that a communications equipment operator, earning $34/hour, would 
spend a total of 1 hour per outage to send out two notifications for each of an estimated 39,000 outages, for a total of 
$1,326,000 [$34/hour  x 1 hour x 39,000].  Our estimate of 39,000 outages is based on the incidence of outages that 
potentially affected  911 in NORS reports during 2021.   We assume that the maximum number of 988 outages that 
would require notifications annually will not exceed the number of 911 outages.   We expect that our estimate of the 
cost will reduce significantly over time as the Commission collects better data on the actual number of 988 outages 
experienced annually.  
109 To transmit an e -mail survey, we estimate that for each of the 2,890 affected carriers, one worker, earning 
$34/hour, at most 15 minutes each year to e -mail the survey of contact information to the three 988 special facilities, 
and to follow up with those special facilities if needed, for a total of $25,000 [$34/hour x 0.25 hours x 2,890 = 
$24,565, rounded up to  $25,000].

 T
herefore, to the extent small entities have or will implement the 911 outage reporting requirements 
already adopted by the Commission, compliance with 988 reporting requirements should not impose 
significant additional costs.  
34. We considered whether there are any special characteristics of 988 calls that would make 
it more effective or efficient for the Commission to adopt alternative outage reporting requirements that do not resemble the reporting requirements for 911 or other communications outages; whether our proposed outage duration and user minute thresholds are appropriate, and whether there may be information that is unique to 988 outages that we should require to be included in an outage report due to 
its value in understanding the cause or impacts of such an outage, and determined that seeking comment 
from providers on these issues could provide more comprehensive insight on these issues.  In comments, small entities can include any steps that we have not already proposed to prevent the costs of our proposals from being unduly burdensome for them.  Small entities can also identify which proposed requirements are particularly difficult or costly for them, and how different, simplified, or consolidated requirements would address those difficulties, and propose any modifications or exemptions from the 
proposed requirements discussing the effect of any such modifications on public safety, and the reliability 
of 988 Lifeline operations.  For the alternatives we discuss in the Notice,  or that are subsequently filed in 
comments, we have requested that commenters address the costs and benefits.  We have also sought comment on the costs and benefits of implementing and maintaining the 911 procedures for 988 outage notification and reporting.  
35. To increase public awareness of 988 availability and to help protect the public’s safety 
when 988 services are disrupted, we have proposed SAMHSA, the VA, and the 988 Lifeline administrator as the designated 988 special facilities to receive notification of outages.  In the Notice  however, we also 
seek comment on whether there are additional entities that should receive notice, whether covered 988 service providers should give notice to originating service providers when an outage occurs to notify their customers of 988 outages, and whether PSAPs should be notified so they can be prepared for call volume 
increases.  We propose that notifications be made by telephone and in writing by electronic means, and 
also give providers the flexibility to provide notice by alternative means if mutually agreed upon in writing in advance by the 988 special facility and the provider, as we currently allow covered 911 service providers to do.  We believe that this means of communication will not be a very resource intensive or costly method for small entities and other service providers to provide notice.  We seek comment on this 
approach in the Notice  and on requiring other methods of notification, which may identify additional 
opportunities to reduce costs for small entities and other providers.  
36. Next, our actions specifically seeking comment on whether the public interest would be 
served by allowing additional time for small and medium -sized businesses to comply, could reduce the 
economic impact for small entities.  In doing so, we have provided small entities the opportunity to 
address whether and how they would benefit from different reporting requirements or timetables that take 
into account their limited resources; simplification or consolidation of reporting requirements for small 
entities; or an exemption from any reporting requirements.  
37. The Commission expects to consider more fully the economic impact on small entities 
following its review of any comments filed in response to the Notice , including any costs and benefits 
information we receive.  The Commission’s evaluation of the comments filed in this proceeding will 
shape the final alternatives we consider, the final conclusions we reach, and any final actions we 
ultimately take in this proceeding to minimize any significant economic impact that may occur on small entities.

Re: Ensuring the Reliability and Resiliency of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , PS Docket No. 23 -5;

PS Docket No. 15 -80; Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, 
WC Docket No. 18 -336, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (January 26, 2023).  
 
If you cross the William Howard Taft Bridge in Washington, you will notice that it connects two 
neighborhoods in the city high above Rock Creek Park.  You might also notice that at the entry to the 
bridge is a sign reminding those who cross in distress that help is available.  Just dial 988.  
 
That sign is new.  Because it was just six months ago that this agency formally designated 988 as 
the three-digit number for the national Suicide and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline.  It’s simple and easy to 
remember.  And during the last half year it has proven to be a lifesaver.  
 
In fact, there are now more than two million people who have reached out to 988.  That is two 
million people in crisis; two million people who found a place to turn, someone to listen, and a way to 
receive support.  Those who attempt suicide are disproportionately young, and some populations —
veterans, indigenous people, and LGBTQ youth, are especially vulnerable.  They deserve our attention, compassion, and help.  
 
I am proud that the people on this dais helped ensure that 988 is available for both calling and 
texting.  The later, of course, is the dominant way to connect for many people in this country, including some of the populations who are most at risk.  It is essential that help is available this way.  
 
It is just as essential that 988 is reliable.  So when in December of last year the hotline had a 
nationwide calling outage, we kicked into high gear.  While the Department of Health and Human Services went to work to make sure the public was aware of other ways to access this service, at the Federal Communications Commission we started an investigation.  We also immediately started to 
develop the rulemaking we have here today.  To be clear, we are seeking to develop reporting and 
notification requirements for 988 outages based on the same system we use for 911.  Like with 911, it is vital that any 988 problems are shared fast with the right people - so that we understand what went wrong and can make it right.  Here we propose that outage notifications are shared with the Department of Health and Human Services’ Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the 988 administrator.  But what we are really trying to do with this 
effort is make sure problems like the one we saw in December do not happen again.  
 
Thank you to those responsible for this rulemaking, including Rochelle Cohen, Shabbir Hamid,

Re: Ensuring the Reliability and Resiliency of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline , PS Docket No. 23 -5; 
Amendments to Part 4 of the Commission’s Rules Concerning Disruptions to Communications , 
PS Docket No. 15 -80; Implementation of the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, 
WC Docket No. 18 -336, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (January 26, 2023).  
Our important work designating 988 as the three -digit dialing code for the Suicide & Crisis 
Lifeline has, critically, tracked the trajectory of the global COVID- 19 pandemic.  This wasn’t the intent, 
of course – the FCC first issued its report to Congress recommending that a three-digit code be used for 
the Lifeline in 2019.  But I note that we adopted our report and order officially designating 988 as that 
code – requiring all covered providers to make all changes necessary to make it a reality – in July 2020.  
That was only months into an unprecedented health crisis that, in addition to claiming lives, was compounding the mental health issues that so many Americans manage every day. 
Mental health issues are a great leveler.  They cut across race, class, age, gender – that much is 
clear.  But at the same time, CDC data shows that suicidal thoughts and attempts are particularly high among vulnerable and underserved members of our society, including LGBTQ+ youth, veterans, Native Americans, and Black Americans.
1  The same week that we issued our 988 order, just a few weeks after 
George Floyd’s death, I convened a panel discussion on the role of the media and communications technology in addressing Black mental health.
2  Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus’ Emergency Taskforce on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health, spoke passionately about the significant disparities in access to mental health care.  We heard from academics, advocates, and media leaders who are working to address this issue – from ensuring that the media 
elevates an accurate narrative of Black mental health, to promoting new ways to access telehealth services.  
As a citizen, a Commissioner, and a Black parent, I continue to care deeply about the role the 
FCC has to play in this conversation.  And I’m proud to approve the FCC’s actions to support access to the 988 Lifeline.  The proposal we approve today – extending the reliability and resiliency requirements 
that apply to 911 to 988 – makes eminent sense.  People who call 988 are experiencing an emergency, just 
like people who call 911.  988 delivers a life -saving service, again like 911 does.  And when 988 is down, 
we need to be able to act quickly to maintain the public’s access to its services, just like we do with 911.  These proposed rules would do just that.  
Thank you to the staff of the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau for their work on this
