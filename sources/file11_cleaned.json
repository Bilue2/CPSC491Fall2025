C. 20500 Dear Mr. President Attached for your review is the Federal Communications Commissions Annual Performance Report for Fiscal Year 1999. We are pleased with the results of our efforts. We met or partially met sixty of our sixty-nine goalsan 87 percent success rate. In addition to our program goals, we embarked on an ambitious course of action to completely revise our Strategic Plan to ensure that our plan reflects the goals of a converging and increasingly global telecommunications industry. In redoing our plan, we reached out to industry, to state, regional, and local governments, to academe and consumer interest groups, and to our own employees to provide us with input into the plan. In August 1999, we issued a draft Strategic Plan that, I believe, provides measurable, results-oriented performance goals for the next five years. Another notable achievement in Fiscal Year 1999 was the completion of our plan to consolidate our enforcement and consumer information activities. Historically, the FCC has been organized along the traditional lines of wire, wireless, satellite, broadcast and cable communications. This traditional structure no longer makes sense in an era when the lines dividing many communications service providers are blurring. Consolidation of our consumer information services will allow us to provide improved information services to consumers facing a bewildering choice of competing telecommunications services. Centralization of our enforcement activities will allow us to respond quickly and efficiently to questionable activities in an increasingly deregulated marketplace. Moreover, our consumer information and enforcement staff will share information that will enable us to spot trends and areas of consumer and industry concern. I would also like to note that we achieved this level of success despite some formidable programmatic obstacles, including  A multi-phased, logistically complex agency move that required that we maintain duplicate operations for seven months. This move, and the need to maintain two separate sites, challenged our resources, particularly our information technology infrastructure  An in-depth review of all our mission critical automated processing systems to ensure that each system was fully Year-2000 compliant. This effort required a months-long review and testing of our major systems and the identification of all smaller systems that required conversion before December 31, 1999.  In addition, we completed a Business Continuity and Contingency Plan for every automated system, major or minor, in case our reviews failed to identify all Y2k problems. The need to complete these reviews and contingency plans resulted in our deferring scheduled enhancements or replacements to several major licensing and document management systems  Failure to obtain the necessary funding in Fiscal Year 1999 to upgrade our network infrastructure and to complete several of the performance goals specified in our Fiscal Year 1999 Annual Performance Plan. For example, we deferred completion of the implementation of two of the Mass Media Bureaus electronic filing systems and an agency-wide electronic document management system. We plan to complete work on these systems in Fiscal Year 2000, if additional funding can be obtained. I look forward to hearing your comments on our Annual Performance Plan. Sincerely, William E. Kennard Chairman Enclosure FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FISCAL YEAR 1999 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REPORT Functional Area Authorization of Service Objective 1 We will meet our established customer Speed of Disposal processing goals.

In May, we adopted an order substantially revising and, in some cases, eliminating the International Settlements Policy. We also streamlined electronic filing of 15 key broadcast application and reporting forms, representing 88 percent of all broadcast authorization forms. A competitive bidding process was approved to replace the comparative hearing process for the selection of mutually exclusive broadcast applicants. We adopted new, simplified rules for the equipment authorization process, deregulating the equipment authorization requirements for certain types of equipment, and providing for electronic filing. Finally, we are nearing completion on the development and implementation of a Universal Licensing System that provides streamlined electronic Internet filing capabilities for most wireless services, provides application and tracking status information and reduces the number of wireless application forms from 63 to five. We will meet 90 of our customer Partially The majority of license applications in all services were processed within established Performance was measured through Speed of Disposal processing Met timeframes.

We also updated and streamlined our broadcast rules and modified the local TV duopoly restrictions and our local radioTV cross-ownership rules.  The FCC made significant progress in streamlining our procedures for satellite and other international application processing issues. We issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking recommending streamlining and consolidating service rules governing the Direct Satellite Broadcast DBS service to eliminate unnecessary and duplicative regulation, increase competition to the cable television industry, and facilitate the delivery of new and innovative services to consumers. We adopted an order streamlining the Section 214 authorization process that will allow 99 percent of all applications to be processed in fourteen days. We adopted an order substantially revising and, in some cases, eliminating the International Settlements Policy. We announced that we will automatically grant routine satellite earth station applications proposing use of the Ku-band and communicating with all satellites authorized to provide service to the U.S. within 35 days from the date of the public notice provided no objections have been filed. Finally, we released an order substantially revising the settlement rate benchmark condition for facilities-based service on affiliated foreign routes.  The FCC completed its comprehensive streamlining of wireless licensing rules in the Universal Licensing System rulemaking, Issuing a Memorandum Opinion and Order in June 1999. We also initiated a rulemaking focusing on streamlining of its Part 90 rules for private land mobile radio services, and completed a rulemaking that simplified and streamlined the Part 97 Amateur Radio Service rules. 10 Functional Area Enforcement Objective 1 We will streamline our complaints process and procedures to ensure timely and satisfactory resolution of consumer complaints.

In Fiscal Year 1999 the FCC completed a number of agency-wide reviews. These included  Consolidation of our Enforcement and Consumer Information Activities. The FCC is currently structured along the traditional technology lines of wire, wireless, satellite, broadcast, and cable communications. This organizational model no longer reflects the industries we oversee. We have determined that the FCC must reorganize along functional rather than technology lines to allow us to perform our core responsibilities more effectively. One of our major performance goals for our Fiscal Year Annual Performance Plan was to complete work on consolidating our consumer information and enforcement functions. Our enforcement activities were distributed among all our major bureaus while our consumer information services activities were more centrally located between two organizations. Before we could consolidate these activities, we had to review the current resources, including staffing and information technology support systems to identify what the new business model should include and to determine the best means to proceed with the consolidation. Extensive reviews were conducted throughout the fiscal year and a reorganization plan was completed that was implemented on November 11, 1999.  Year 2000 Readiness Review. The FCC conducted independent testing of all twenty-three mission-critical systems to verify that the systems were ready for the millennium. The system tests were conducted by an independent contractor and tested on separate test hardware. In addition, our Computer Security Office successfully completed assessments of all our new major applications designed for use within the FCC network. Eight application reviews were conducted to ensure compliance with relevant OMB guidance on computer-based system development and management, including OMB Circular A-123, Management Accountability and Control, OMB Circular A-27, Financial Management Systems, and OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources.  Revisions to our Strategic Plan and Strategic Planning Process. In March and May 1999, Chairman William Kennard, along with the other FCC Commissioners, testified before our Congressional oversight committees. As part of his testimony Chairman Kennard submitted a draft report, A New FCC for the 21st Century. This report served as a conceptual framework for FCC senior managers to meet and develop a new framework for our Strategic Plan. Part of this process was a review of all our organizations and functions to ascertain if they were still essential to the agencys newly defined core functions. We also gathered extensive input from our stakeholders through three public fora seeking the views of general industry, consumer, state, and local government representatives, academic and organizational experts, and from Commission staff. The feedback provided at these fora focused on similar themes 1 universal service, consumer protection and information 2 enforcement and promotion of competitive markets domestically and worldwide and 3 spectrum management. We incorporated many of these themes into the draft Strategic Plan that we submitted to Congress in August 1999 and in our draft Annual Performance Plan.  Business Process Re-EngineeringElectronic Filing Initiatives. In Fiscal Year 1999, the FCC completed planning for consolidating, streamlining and providing electronic filing capabilities for all major Mass Media Bureau licensing systems. Before design work could begin, a complete analysis of workload processes was completed to identify outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary processes and procedures. While all planning work was completed, system implementation was deferred due to lack of adequate funding and the need to address higher priority, Year-2000 issues. 20"
