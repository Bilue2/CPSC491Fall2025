{'prompt': 'What was the impact of Hurricane Helene on cell phone services in affected areas?', 'completion': 'The hurricane caused significant disruptions to communication networks, including prolonged cell site outages in several counties across Florida, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia.'}
{'prompt': 'How did wireless providers respond to the outages caused by Hurricane Helene?', 'completion': 'Wireless providers engaged in preparation and restoration efforts, though they faced challenges due to damaged infrastructure, inaccessible cell sites, and power outages.'}
{'prompt': 'What role does the federal government play in restoring cell phone services after a disaster?', 'completion': 'The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can deploy communication assets to support recovery efforts, while the FCC monitors networks and provides status updates to government officials and the public.'}
{'prompt': 'What is the Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS)?', 'completion': 'DIRS is a web-based system activated by the FCC for providers to report network status during disasters, helping coordinate recovery efforts with emergency management officials.'}
{'prompt': 'What does the FCCâ€™s Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative involve?', 'completion': 'The MDRI allows the FCC to require mobile wireless providers to coordinate during disasters, building on an existing voluntary agreement among major service providers to ensure communication access.'}
{"prompt": "What actions did the FCC and private sector take before Hurricane Helene to prepare for communication disruptions?", "completion": "Before Hurricane Helene made landfall, the U.S. government and private telecommunication providers took several measures to prepare. The FCC activated the Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS) and the Mandatory Disaster Response Initiative (MDRI) for select counties. Private companies like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile fortified networks, deployed mobile assets, and coordinated with state and local agencies to ensure preparedness."}
{"prompt": "What actions did the FCC take in response to Hurricane Helene to manage communication outages?", "completion": "The FCC expanded the activation area to include additional counties, issued daily communications status reports with cell site outages, announced the deactivation of DIRS and MDRI for certain areas while retaining reporting for others, waived eligibility requirements under its Lifeline program to offer discounted services, and granted special authority for Starlink direct-to-cell satellite services."}
{"prompt": "How did wireless service providers respond during Hurricane Helene?", "completion": "Wireless service providers reported network outages, responded to public safety agency requests, enabled roaming, continued to supply batteries and fuel to generators, deployed temporary cell sites, and offered charging stations and Wi-Fi in affected areas."}
{"prompt": "What actions did the FCC take after Hurricane Helene?", "completion": "The FCC continued reporting on outages, granted SpaceX and T-Mobile special temporary authority for satellite services, and considered legislative changes for improved network resiliency and redundancy."}
