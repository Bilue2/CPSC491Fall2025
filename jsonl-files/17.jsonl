They must also demonstrate that they sought service from existing providers in the area before constructing a new network, and that those providers were unable or unwilling to provide sufficient services."}
{"prompt": "Why did the FCC decide not to apply minimum service standards for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program?", "completion": "The FCC opted not to apply minimum service standards to avoid penalizing schools, libraries, students, school staff, and library patrons in areas with slower speed or data capped services, due to the emergency situation and the lack of ubiquitous high-speed broadband nationwide."}
{"prompt": "What are the suggested minimum service standards for bandwidth and data usage for remote learning?", "completion": "The suggested minimum service standards for bandwidth and data usage include a target of 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload, but not as a limit. There's also a recommendation for a mandated 25 Mbps/3 Mbps with a 1024 GB monthly data usage limit, and a limitation on high latency service (over 100 ms) to support interactive real-time applications. Additionally, some comments suggest that 25 Mbps/3 Mbps may be inadequate for remote learning."} 

{"prompt": "Why is there a need for clarification in the exceptions for commercially available services?", "completion": "Clarification is needed to ensure the exceptions account for instances where the signal is too weak to support remote learning. Additionally, there is a need for clear evidence from applicants to demonstrate their compliance and determination that they meet the requirements of the exception."} 

{"prompt": "Why do some commenters believe that 25 Mbps/3 Mbps is inadequate for remote learning?", "completion": "Some commenters believe that 25 Mbps/3 Mbps is inadequate for remote learning as it may constrain students' ability to participate in synchronous learning and may not accommodate interactive real-time applications. They also highlight that additional bandwidth is necessary for accessibility services needed by individuals with disabilities."}

{"prompt": "How are schools and libraries expected to manage their remote learning needs according to the FCC?", "completion": "Schools and libraries are expected to make the best decisions to meet the remote learning needs of their students, staff, or patrons based on their understanding of available and sufficient resources.
