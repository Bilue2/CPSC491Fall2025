{"prompt": "What are the three methods healthcare providers can use to calculate rural rates under the Telecom Program?", "completion": "(1) The average of rates that the carrier charges to other non-health care provider commercial customers for the same or similar services in the rural area where the provider is located. (2) If no commercial customers exist in the rural area, the average of tariffed and publicly available rates by other providers for similar services over the same distance. (3) A cost-based rate approved by the Commission or relevant state commission, if no rates exist or are deemed unfair by the carrier."}
{'prompt': 'What must health care providers and service providers do when the service provider selected is not charging non-health care provider customers rates in the rural area?', 'completion': 'They must attempt to calculate a rural rate using Method 2.'}
{'prompt': 'What should be done if no tariffed or publicly available rates are charged by other service providers for similar services in the rural area, or the calculated rate is unfair?', 'completion': 'Health care providers and service providers may calculate a rural rate using Method 3.'}
{'prompt': 'When is a rural rate approval required for a service in a multi-year contract?', 'completion': 'Only in the first year of the evergreen contract or another form of the multi-year contract, unless the rural rates or other substantive terms change.'}
{"prompt": "Why did the Commission decide against using competitive bidding alone to determine fair market rural rates?", "completion": "The Commission found that relying solely on competitive bidding could lead to inflated rural rates, as only a small percentage of Telecom Program funding requests receive competing bids and carriers often compete on non-price characteristics of service."}
{"prompt": "What temporary measure did the Bureau implement for funding year 2023 regarding rural and urban rates?", "completion": "The Bureau permitted the use of previously-approved rural rates and urban rates for funding year 2023 to alleviate burdens as competitive bidding had already started."}
{"prompt": "Under what conditions can the Commission’s rules be waived or suspended?", "completion": "The Commission's rules can be waived or suspended for good cause shown where strict compliance is inconsistent with the public interest, or considerations of hardship, equity, or more effective implementation of overall policy are taken into account."}
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What factors justify a waiver of the Commission’s rules?", "completion": "A waiver is justified if special circumstances warrant a deviation from the general rule and such deviation will serve the public interest."}
{"prompt": "Why might having three different sets of rules for determining cost-based rural rates be problematic?", "completion": "It could present unnecessary administrative burdens and complicate the process for determining rural rates."}
{"prompt": "How does permitting the use of previously-approved rural rates for Method 3 benefit the public interest?", "completion": "It reduces administrative burdens and avoids unnecessary expenditures since market conditions indicate pricing is unlikely to decrease significantly in the following years."}
{"prompt": "Why was a waiver extending the use of previously-approved rates not applied to Method 1 and 2 rural rate approvals?", "completion": "The administrative burden and time for justifications under Methods 1 and 2 are considerably less than for Method 3, making the program integrity benefits more significant."}
{"prompt": "What is the significance of the Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking mentioned in the document?", "completion": "It indicates that the Commission is considering additional changes to its rural rate rules for future funding years, impacting decisions on current waivers."}
```
{"prompt": "What does a service provider do if justifying rates cannot be found under Methods 1 or 2?", "completion": "The service provider has the option to rely on a previously approved Method 3 rate pursuant to the waiver issued."} 
{"prompt": "When can a service provider use a previously-approved rural rate under the Method 3 waiver?", "completion": "A service provider may use a previously-approved rural rate if the funding commitment for the facility/service combination was issued in funding years 2021, 2022, or 2023."} 
{"prompt": "What should participants do if there is no approved rate for a specific facility/service combination?", "completion": "They may use a rural rate for the most recent funding commitment for similar services to the facility with similar geographic characteristics issued in 2021, 2022, or 2023. Otherwise, the rural rate must be established using a Method 3 cost study."} 
{"prompt": "Why were the previous rate methodology rules reinstated?", "completion": "Restoring the previous rate methodology rules helps reduce administrative burdens and is familiar to Program participants, easing the transition while long-term solutions are considered."} 
{"prompt": "Why do some petitioners oppose the median-based approach for determining rural rates?", "completion": "Petitioners like Alaska Communications argue that a median-based approach does not reflect actual rates and therefore does not fulfill section 254(h)(1)(A) requirements, potentially affecting support received."}
{"prompt": "What reasoning does the Commission give in support of a median-based approach?", "completion": "The Commission believes a median approach can approximate rates charged in comparable rural areas, fulfilling the requirement of section 254(h)(1)(A), and preventing outlier prices from skewing support."} 
{"prompt": "What is section 254(h)(1)(A) concerned with?", "completion": "Section 254(h)(1)(A) addresses the obligation for telecommunications carriers to charge rates reasonably comparable to urban rates for similar services provided in rural areas."}
{"prompt": "What issues did the FCC face with determining urban rates using the Rates Database?", "completion": "The FCC faced concerns about the Administrator’s ability to determine accurate urban rates using the Rates Database. After its launch, specific concerns arose about urban rate anomalies, such as urban rates for lower bandwidths exceeding those for higher bandwidths and urban rates exceeding rural rates within a state. This led to a waiver on using the Rates Database for urban rate determination."}
{"prompt": "How did the Bureau respond to the urban rate anomalies identified in the Rates Database?", "completion": "The Bureau acknowledged the urban rate anomalies and concluded that although these examples were not pervasive nationwide, they warranted further investigation. As a result, the Bureau waived the use of the Rates Database for determining urban rates."}
{"prompt": "What solution did the FCC propose for urban rate determination after noting issues with the Rates Database?", "completion": "The FCC decided to reinstate the previous urban rate determination rules, allowing healthcare providers to document the urban rate using tariff pages and other similar documentation. This approach aims to ensure consistency and predictability while considering alternative mechanisms."}
{"prompt": "What documentation must healthcare providers submit to support the urban rate for FCC Form 466?", "completion": "Healthcare providers must document the urban rate using tariff pages, contracts, letters from the urban service provider, or rate pricing information from the urban service provider’s website to show how the urban rate was obtained."}
{'prompt': 'What concerns did the Commission identify with the rate-setting rules in place at the time of adopting the Rates Database?', 'completion': 'The Commission identified concerns with transparency, administrative efficiency, and program integrity.'}
{'prompt': 'What will RHC Program applicants and participating service providers no longer use to calculate rural and urban rates?', 'completion': 'They will no longer use the Rates Database to calculate rural and urban rates.'}
{'prompt': 'What conclusion did the Commission make regarding similar services in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order?', 'completion': 'The Commission determined that similar services can include non-telecommunications services that deliver the same or similar functionality as the requested service, and can include services with advertised speeds 30% above or below the requested service.'}
{'prompt': 'What was USTelecom’s request regarding non-telecommunications services for calculating rates?', 'completion': 'USTelecom requested to reverse the decision that non-telecommunications services that are functionally similar to eligible telecommunications services be considered similar services for rate calculations.'}
{"prompt": "What is the technology-agnostic inquiry regarding similar services?", "completion": "The technology-agnostic inquiry regarding similar services is to view it from the perspective of the end user experience rather than regulatory classification."}
```jsonl
{"prompt": "Did the Commission provide notice and opportunity for comment before expanding the inquiry of functionally similar services to include non-telecommunications services?", "completion": "Yes, the Commission provided notice in the 2017 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of its intent to consider changes to the statutory interpretation of similar services."}
{"prompt": "What was USTelecom's argument regarding the Commission's inquiry into functionally similar services?", "completion": "USTelecom argued that the Commission did not provide notice and opportunity for comment, as required by the APA, before expanding the inquiry to include non-telecommunications services."}
{"prompt": "What standard did the Commission establish for determining if services are functionally similar?", "completion": "The Commission established a voluntary 'safe harbor' whereby a healthcare provider could claim that two services are similar if they fall within one of five speed tiers."}
{"prompt": "What was the Commission’s response to the claim that expanding the inquiry of functionally similar services was arbitrary and capricious?", "completion": "The Commission disagreed with the claim, explaining that the end-user experience, not regulatory classification, guides the analysis of whether services are functionally equivalent."}
{"prompt": "What did the Commission consider when deciding if services are similar, according to the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order?", "completion": "The Commission considered the end-user experience, not regulatory classification."}
```
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What guides the analysis of whether telehealth services are functionally equivalent?", "completion": "The end-user experience, not regulatory classification, guides the analysis of whether telehealth services are functionally equivalent."}
{"prompt": "Why does the Commission include information services with functionally similar telecommunications services?", "completion": "Including information services with functionally similar telecommunications services is consistent with ensuring access to telecommunications services for healthcare providers at rates that are reasonably comparable to urban areas."}
{"prompt": "What is SHLB's stance on the 30% speed threshold for functionally similar services?", "completion": "SHLB argues that the 30% speed threshold is overbroad and includes services that are dissimilar in function and cost, but does not provide examples."}
{"prompt": "How did Alaska Communications describe the 30% bandwidth range?", "completion": "Alaska Communications described the 30% bandwidth range as 'not unreasonable,' but noted there is insufficient rural rate data in Alaska for a complete rural rate methodology."}
{"prompt": "What argument does NTCA present regarding the 30% speed threshold?", "completion": "NTCA argues that the 30% speed threshold is too broad and suggests implementing a smaller margin based on healthcare provider use cases, but provides no examples."}
{"prompt": "What did the Commission conclude about maintaining the 30% speed threshold?", "completion": "The Commission concluded that the 30% range allows for rate predictability while accounting for rising demand for faster connectivity, and it's preferable to having speed tiers."}
{"prompt": "What could the clarification in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order be considered regarding Commission's rules?", "completion": "The clarification could be considered a revised interpretation of the Commission's rules to include non-telecommunications services as functionally similar."}
```
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What is the preferred method for determining similar services in the context of rate predictability?", "completion": "A standard based on a range is preferred over speed tiers, as it avoids frequent updates and provides a large number of inputs for determining rates."}
{"prompt": "Why is maintaining the current threshold for similar services beneficial?", "completion": "It eases program administration because health care providers are already familiar with the standard of advertised speeds being 30% above or below the requested service's speed."}
{"prompt": "What is SHLB's concern regarding the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order?", "completion": "SHLB asserts that it fails to account for price variations due to contract terms or volume discounts, which could distort rural rate determinations."}
{"prompt": "How did the Commission address SHLB's concern about price variations affecting rural rates?", "completion": "The Commission explained that section 254(h)(1)(A) requires that rates be reasonably comparable to urban areas, taking into account price variations."}
{"prompt": "What flexibility does the Commission provide regarding rates when there is no comparable rural rate within 30% of the requested service speed?", "completion": "Service providers can justify the requested rural rate using a comparable service with higher bandwidth if the requested service's speed exceeds that of the offered rate."}
{"prompt": "What happens if there is no comparable urban rate within the 30% range?", "completion": "The Commission allows service providers to use the rate for a higher bandwidth service that falls outside the 30% range but is otherwise similar to the requested service."}
{"prompt": "What was Alaska Communications' petition about, and what was the outcome?", "completion": "Alaska Communications sought clarification on including service delivery dates in site and service substitution, but their petition for reconsideration was denied."}
```
{"prompt": "What is the RHC Program's service substitution rule under FCC regulations?", "completion": "The RHC Program's service substitution rule under section 54.624(a) allows applicants to substitute requested services and modify the funding request in case of a delay in the deployment of the original service. This rule provides flexibility to receive support for substituted services when specific requirements are met."}
{"prompt": "What can participants in the HCF Program report on their invoicing forms?", "completion": "Participants in the HCF Program can report updates to service start dates on their invoicing forms."} 

{"prompt": "How can participants request a service delivery date extension?", "completion": "Participants may request a service delivery date extension prior to the end of the same funding year by contacting the Administrator."}

{"prompt": "What does the FCC say about creating administrative burdens due to service date modifications?", "completion": "The FCC states that the process of modifying service dates is no more administratively burdensome than the service substitution request process."}

{"prompt": "What is Alaska Communications' request regarding the Administrator contacting health care providers?", "completion": "Alaska Communications requests that when the Administrator contacts a health care provider with questions, they should also communicate with the relevant service provider."}

{"prompt": "Does the FCC require the Administrator to issue information requests to service providers?", "completion": "No, the FCC declines to require the Administrator to issue information requests to service providers, as it would be administratively burdensome and a poor use of resources."}

{"prompt": "What is dismissed as moot concerning the Rates Database challenges?", "completion": "All other challenges to the Rates Database raised in the petitions for reconsideration that are not applicable to rural or urban rate determinations are dismissed as moot."}
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What did the decision to eliminate the use of the Rates Database impact?", "completion": "It rendered challenges to urban and rural rate determinations moot."}
{"prompt": "What are rurality tiers used for in the event that demand exceeds available support?", "completion": "Rurality tiers are used to prioritize support when demand exceeds available funding."}
{"prompt": "What are the three tiers of rurality established by the Commission in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order?", "completion": "The tiers are Extremely Rural, Rural, and Less Rural, with Extremely Rural further bifurcated for health care providers in Alaska to include a Frontier tier."}
{"prompt": "What argument did stakeholders make against the rurality tiers in the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order?", "completion": "Stakeholders argued that the rurality tiers impacted rates determinations in the Rates Database."}
```
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What was the decision regarding the rurality tiers in the FCC's Promoting Telehealth Report and Order?", "completion": "The FCC decided to maintain the rurality tiers as a means of prioritizing support, dismissing petitions to eliminate them. They are viewed as appropriate for targeting RHC Program funding to less populous areas when prioritization of funds is necessary."}
{"prompt": "Why did the FCC dismiss USTelecom's petition related to FCC Forms 461 and 465?", "completion": "The FCC dismissed USTelecom's petition because it sought modifications and clarifications that were outside the scope of the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order."}
{"prompt": "How does the FCC determine which areas are considered 'Frontier areas'?", "completion": "The FCC defines Frontier areas as those outside a Core Based Statistical Area that are inaccessible by road, using data from the Alaska Department of Commerce Community and Economic Development."}
{"prompt": "Why did NCTNA/SOHCN petition the FCC regarding rurality tiers?", "completion": "NCTNA/SOHCN petitioned the FCC to use metropolitan and micropolitan designations instead of rurality tiers, proposing that this method would allow the Administrator to pre-qualify sites, accurately demonstrate rurality, and determine funding priority more precisely."}
{"prompt": "What alternative does the FCC suggest for parsing rurality in health care funding?", "completion": "The FCC does not suggest an alternative mechanism, as the record lacks any better options for parsing rurality for this purpose."}
{"prompt": "What is the FCC's rationale for maintaining current rurality tiers?", "completion": "The FCC maintains the current rurality tiers due to consistent alignment with long-held definitions of 'rural' and to avoid potential confusion and administrative burdens that might arise from changes."}
```
{"prompt": "What decision did the Commission make regarding the concept of Frontier Areas in the context of the Rates Database?", "completion": "The Commission decided to eliminate the concept of Frontier Areas from the rules because it does not apply to prioritizing support."}
{"prompt": "Where are the rurality tiers retained after the elimination of certain rules?", "completion": "The rurality tiers are retained in section 54.621(b), which addresses prioritization of support."}
{"prompt": "What was the response to NCTNA/SOHCN's petition for reconsideration regarding funding for multi-year commitments?", "completion": "The Commission denied the petition for reconsideration requesting an increase to the internal cap on funding for upfront payments and multi-year commitments."}
{"prompt": "Why did the Commission retain the internal cap on multi-year commitments and upfront payments?", "completion": "The Commission retained the internal cap to protect against possible underfunding of single-year funding requests and an increase in the internal cap may adversely affect single-year requests."}

```
{'prompt': 'What are urban rates and how were they documented according to the pre-funding year 2020 urban rate rules?', 'completion': 'Urban rates are determined by the health care provider, often with the assistance of a consultant or carrier, and reported on the FCC Form 466. To document the urban rate, health care providers may use “tariff pages, contracts, a letter on company letterhead from the urban service provider, rate pricing information printed from the urban service provider’s website or similar documentation showing how the urban rate was obtained.”'}
{'prompt': 'What is one advantage of utilizing the urban rates posted to the Administrator’s website?', 'completion': 'One advantage is that health care providers did not need to provide additional documentation on their FCC Form 466.'}
{'prompt': 'What decision has the Commission made regarding the Rates Database and how should urban rates be posted moving forward?', 'completion': 'The Commission has decided to eliminate the Rates Database. It’s under discussion whether the Administrator should resume posting urban rates as was done before the Promoting Telehealth Report and Order or if the posting is unnecessary or of limited utility.'}
{'prompt': 'Should there be any changes to the now-reinstated urban rate rules on a forward-going basis?', 'completion': 'The Commission is exploring whether any adjustments are needed to the urban rate rules and whether health care providers should use the median of urban rates in the Rates Database.'}
{'prompt': 'Should the Commission maintain a Rates Database for urban rates?', 'completion': 'The Commission is considering whether to require the Administrator to maintain a Rates Database for urban rates and ensure that urban rates are calculated using it.'}
{'prompt': 'Should a rate survey be used instead of the Administrator to determine urban rates?', 'completion': 'The Commission is evaluating the use of a rate survey to determine urban rates and is considering how often it should be updated.'}
{'prompt': 'What is the population threshold for determining an urban area?', 'completion': "The standard for 'urban' is 'functionally similar service in any city with a population of 50,000 or more.' The Commission is considering whether to maintain this threshold."}
{'prompt': 'What was the original reason for the inclusion of satellite services in the RHC Program?', 'completion': 'Satellite service was originally included because it was the only telecommunications service available in some rural areas.'}
{'prompt': 'Why did the Commission cap support for satellite services in some rural areas?', 'completion': 'Satellite services were often more expensive than terrestrial services, so the Commission capped the support in areas where terrestrial services were available.'}
{"prompt": "What happened when the FCC eliminated the cap on support for satellite services for rural health care providers?", "completion": "The FCC eliminated the cap effective for funding year 2020, as they believed the limitation was unnecessary due to decreasing satellite service costs and the determination of rural rates by the Rates Database. This move was intended to further technological neutrality and reduce the need for cap due to improved competitive bidding rules."}
{"prompt": "What was the impact on commitments for satellite services after the FCC's waiver of the rates database?", "completion": "After the FCC's waiver of the rates database, commitments for satellite services dipped slightly in funding year 2020 but increased significantly thereafter, indicating a rise in demand."}
{"prompt": "Why is the FCC considering reinstating the cap on satellite services?", "completion": "The FCC is considering reinstating the cap because the predicted constraints on the price of satellite services did not occur, and support for satellite services increased significantly, potentially reaching an unsustainable level."}
{"prompt": "What are the questions the FCC is seeking comments on regarding satellite services?", "completion": "The FCC seeks comments on whether the increase in satellite service commitments reflects increased prices after eliminating the cap or if health care providers are choosing satellite services due to competitiveness with terrestrial-based services. They also question if service providers are less likely to bid on or upgrade terrestrial services due to the cap being lifted, and if the availability of LEO satellites has affected satellite service rates."}
{'prompt': 'Why might organizations be less likely to bid on or upgrade networks for terrestrial services with the lifting of the cap?', 'completion': 'Organizations might be less inclined to bid on or upgrade networks for terrestrial services because the cap that previously limited satellite service investments has been lifted, possibly leading to increased competition and altered investment strategies.'}
{'prompt': 'Have rates for satellite services dropped enough to make the cap unnecessary?', 'completion': 'Yes, the availability of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites has potentially led to reduced rates for satellite services, which could render the previous cap unnecessary.'}
{'prompt': 'Why did demand for satellite services increase significantly in recent years?', 'completion': 'Demand for satellite services has increased due to improved technology, such as LEO satellites, which offer enhanced performance and expanded coverage.'}
{'prompt': 'Should the cap on support for satellite services be reconsidered in cases where satellite service provides redundancy?', 'completion': 'Yes, it may be appropriate to reconsider the cap in cases where satellite service offers redundancy in the absence of alternative terrestrial-based route diversity.'}
{'prompt': 'Could reinstating the cap discourage investment in LEO satellites?', 'completion': 'Reinstating the cap could potentially discourage investment in LEO satellites by limiting the financial incentive to develop these technologies.'}
{'prompt': 'What role should the RHC Program’s historical preference for technological neutrality play in this decision?', 'completion': 'The RHC Program’s historical preference for technological neutrality should be considered, as it supports a balanced approach to infrastructure development without bias towards specific technologies.'}
{'prompt': 'Should the cap apply to satellite service contracts signed before the cap’s reinstatement?', 'completion': 'The cap may not apply to funding requests for satellite service contracts entered into before its reinstatement to honor existing agreements.'}
{'prompt': 'Do commenters in Alaska have specific concerns about reinstating the cap?', 'completion': 'Commenters in Alaska may have concerns about reinstating the cap due to the critical role satellite services play in the region’s connectivity.'}
{'prompt': 'Should HCF Program rules be amended to allow network equipment to be eligible under both HCF and Telecom Program services?', 'completion': 'Amending HCF Program rules to make network equipment eligible under both HCF and Telecom Program services could improve reliability and service integration.'}
{'prompt': 'What financial impact might expanding HCF-eligible equipment to Telecom Program services have?', 'completion': 'Expanding HCF-eligible equipment to support Telecom Program services could potentially reduce overall Telecom Program expenditures and increase budget flexibility.'}
{'prompt': 'Should entities that will soon become eligible health care providers be allowed to receive RHC Program funding earlier?', 'completion': 'Entities poised to become eligible health care providers should potentially be allowed to receive RHC Program funding shortly after eligibility to prevent delays in accessing necessary support.'}
{'prompt': 'What happens if a health care provider misses the application filing window on April 1?', 'completion': 'They would have to wait until a subsequent funding year to receive RHC Program funding, which could result in a delay of a full calendar year.'} 

{'prompt': 'What proposal has been made to address delays in funding for health care providers?', 'completion': 'The proposal is to amend sections 54.601 and 54.622 to allow entities soon to be eligible as health care providers to request and receive a “conditional approval of eligibility.”'}

{'prompt': 'What must an applicant do after receiving conditional eligibility approval?', 'completion': 'The applicant can conduct competitive bidding and submit a Request for Funding, but no funding decision will be made until they update their eligibility request with proper documentation.'}

{'prompt': 'What change is proposed for section 54.601 of the Commission’s rules?', 'completion': 'The proposed change is to allow entities to request and receive conditional approval of eligibility to expedite the RHC Program funding process.'}

{"prompt": "What type of hardships does SHLB claim regarding corrective SPIN changes?", "completion": "SHLB claims that corrective SPIN changes create a recurring hardship due to their nature and the current deadline alignment with the service delivery deadline."}
```
{'prompt': 'What is a corrective SPIN change in the RHC Program?', 'completion': 'A corrective SPIN change is requested to correct ministerial errors or update a SPIN that resulted from a merger or acquisition of companies, or when a service provider assigns one of its multiple SPINs to a funding request without advising the healthcare provider of the correct SPIN before invoicing begins.'}
{'prompt': 'Why does SHLB request a change to the corrective SPIN change deadline?', 'completion': 'SHLB supports changing the corrective SPIN change deadline due to mergers and acquisitions that can happen any time during the funding year and situations where a service provider assigns a SPIN without informing the healthcare provider, often after the service delivery deadline.'}
{'prompt': 'What are the potential issues discussed with delaying the corrective SPIN change deadline?', 'completion': 'Delaying the deadline to October 28 could reduce the need for applicants to seek deadline waivers, but may result in Program participants delaying SPIN change requests and missing the invoice deadline, if submitted too close to the new deadline.'}
{'prompt': 'What argument does SHLB make to justify the proposed deadline change for SPIN changes?', 'completion': 'SHLB maintains that changing the deadline to allow additional time for processing requests would reduce the need for applicants to request deadline waivers from the Commission, thus reducing administrative burdens.'}
{"prompt": "Should deadlines for SPIN change requests be aligned between the RHC and E-Rate programs?", "completion": "Aligning deadlines could prevent confusion and streamline processes, but potential misalignment might offer flexibility and cater to unique program needs."} 
{"prompt": "What is an evergreen contract in the context of healthcare providers?", "completion": "An evergreen contract is a multi-year agreement exempt from competitive bidding for its duration, based on estimated service dates provided by healthcare providers."}
{"prompt": "Why might there be a need to change evergreen contract dates?", "completion": "Services start later than initially estimated, causing contracts to expire earlier than they would based on the actual start date, necessitating a potential change."}
{"prompt": "What challenges could arise from allowing changes to evergreen contract dates?", "completion": "It might complicate the processing of funding requests and require alterations in rules or their interpretation."}
{"prompt": "What updates are proposed for FCC Form 466?", "completion": "Revisions aim to improve accuracy of service categorization and cost-based rates by collecting detailed data from service providers."}
{"prompt": "Why is there a need to revise the Telecom Program’s service data collection?", "completion": "Current data is too vague, resulting in disparate rates for comparable services, prompting a need for detailed categorization and SLA incorporation."}
{"prompt": "What revisions are proposed for improving the FCC Form 466 data collection?", "completion": "The revisions proposed for FCC Form 466 include collecting more granular information about the services purchased by health care providers, such as contract type, geographic region of coverage, contract duration, discounts, and service level agreements that apply to the contract."}
```jsonl
{"prompt": "What information is collected for endpoint services in a contract?", "completion": "The data collected includes the number of endpoints serviced, the geographic region, contract duration, applicable discounts, service level agreements, and total price including RHC supported services."}
{"prompt": "What must be reported about each connection endpoint in service details?", "completion": "For each endpoint, the location (latitude and longitude), distance (if applicable), connectivity type, application type, and the service or product must be reported. Additionally, equipment vendor/model, technology, bandwidth, SLA coverage, access media, and monthly price are required."}
{"prompt": "How are different connection types defined for endpoints?", "completion": "Connection types for endpoints can be Point-to-Point, Point-to-Multipoint, or Multipoint-to-Multipoint."}
