{"prompt": "What is the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) and how has its use changed since its launch in 2012?", "completion": "IPAWS is a system that enables authorized alerting authorities to send Wireless Emergency Alerts to mobile devices and Emergency Alert System alerts to media platforms. Its use has increased significantly since its launch in 2012, with more than 1,400 alerting authorities having access by September 2019, up from fewer than 100 in 2013."}
{"prompt": "What roles do FEMA and the FCC play in the operation of IPAWS?", "completion": "FEMA operates the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) establishes the rules for telecommunications providers to deliver Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) and Emergency Alert System (EAS) alerts."}
{"prompt": "What issues did the GAO find regarding local authority access to IPAWS?", "completion": "The GAO found that there are gaps in local authority access to IPAWS, which could limit the timeliness of alerts during emergencies. As of September 2019, there were 430 pending IPAWS applications, some dating back to 2012, indicating a need for FEMA to establish procedures to prioritize and follow up with applicants."}
{"prompt": "What recommendation is made to FEMA in relation to pending IPAWS applications?", "completion": "It is recommended that FEMA establish procedures to prioritize and follow up with applicants for IPAWS to improve access for local authorities and address pending applications, some of which date back to 2012."}
