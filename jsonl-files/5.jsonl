{"prompt": "What concerns have the FAA and aviation operators raised about 5G wireless networks?", "completion": "The concerns are that certain mid-band or C-band 5G signals could interfere with aircraft radio altimeters, potentially affecting flight safety."}
{"prompt": "What actions did telecommunications companies take in response to FAA concerns about 5G rollout?", "completion": "Telecommunications companies agreed to voluntarily delay the rollout of 5G service near airports until July 2022 to avoid air travel disruptions."}
{"prompt": "Which frequency bands for 5G are causing concerns for the aviation industry in the United States?", "completion": "The assignment of C-band frequencies in the range of 3.7 to 3.98 GHz for 5G by the FCC has alarmed the aviation industry over potential interference with radio altimeters."}
{"prompt": "Why are radio altimeters important for aircraft operations?", "completion": "Radio altimeters are important because they provide data for aircraft terrain alerting systems and automated flight control systems, especially useful for vertical guidance below 200 feet in low-visibility conditions during landing."}
```
{"prompt": "What has the FAA and other aviation regulators expressed concern about since 2015 regarding 5G wireless deployments?", "completion": "The FAA and other aviation regulators have raised concerns that 5G signals transmitted on nearby frequencies in the C-band could potentially interfere with radio altimeters, especially if high-powered 5G base stations are located close to airport runways."}
{"prompt": "Why might radio altimeters not successfully block more powerful 5G signals?", "completion": "While most radio altimeters currently in use have mask filters to block nearby signals, it is uncertain if these filters will adequately block more powerful 5G signals in all cases."}
{"prompt": "What did the RTCA conclude about 5G emissions and radio altimeters?", "completion": "The RTCA concluded that expected interference levels from 5G emissions in the 3.7-3.98 GHz range and stray emissions bleeding into the 4.2-4.4 GHz band would likely exceed safe interference limits for radio altimeters on airplanes and helicopters."}
{"prompt": "What action did telecommunications providers take in response to 5G rollout concerns?", "completion": "Telecommunications providers voluntarily delayed the 5G launch from early December 2021 to January 2022 to give the FAA additional time to address radio altimeter interference concerns."}
{"prompt": "How did the FCC respond to the RTCA findings about 5G interference with radio altimeters?", "completion": "The FCC countered that the RTCA's findings assumed a worst-case scenario. They argued that FCC-mandated protections, such as limits on 5G signal strength and 220 MHz of spectral separation, would mitigate interference risks and that engineered radio equipment should not experience harmful interference from 5G signals."}
{"prompt": "What mitigation actions were taken in the U.S. regarding the C-band 5G rollout near airports?", "completion": "Initially, the FAA restricted certain approach procedures at 88 airports due to potential 5G interference. Service providers then agreed to delay activating 5G transmitters near airports until July 5, 2022, to establish temporary 'buffer zones' around airports."}
{"prompt": "How have different countries approached the rollout of 5G near airports?", "completion": "Countries like Canada initially restricted the installation of 5G transmitters near airports, while European concerns have been less, partly because their approved frequencies have greater separation from radio altimeter bands than in the U.S."}
{'prompt': 'What steps have some European countries, like France, taken to mitigate potential conflicts between 5G signals and radio altimeters near airports?', 'completion': 'They have restricted power output of 5G towers, restricted placement of 5G antennas in buffer zones near airports, and required that 5G antennas near airports be tilted downward to reduce interference with flight operations.'}
{'prompt': 'Why are 5G providers in the United States reluctant to agree to certain mitigation measures near airports?', 'completion': 'They fear that such measures could reduce the availability and quality of 5G service around airports and provide a competitive advantage to competitors not using those frequency bands.'}
{'prompt': 'Who is responsible for deciding if existing radio altimeter systems protect against 5G interference in the United States?', 'completion': 'The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for deciding this.'}
{'prompt': 'What has the FAA provisionally approved regarding the use of radio altimeters on U.S. commercial airline fleets as of January 2022?', 'completion': 'The FAA has provisionally approved roughly 90% of the U.S. commercial airline fleet equipped with radio altimeters to conduct low-visibility landings at airports with nearby 5G towers.'}
{'prompt': 'Why might the replacement of radio altimeters be costly for aircraft operators, including the military?', 'completion': 'Because manufacturers need to design, build, and supply new radio altimeter units that are not prone to impacts from C-band 5G, which could be expensive for operators.'}
{'prompt': 'What exemption has the FAA granted to medical helicopters regarding radio altimeter requirements?', 'completion': 'The FAA has granted temporary regulatory relief from radio altimeter requirements for medical helicopters conducting night vision goggle operations, expiring in 2024.'}
{'prompt': 'What challenge related to 5G rollout is of particular interest to Congress?', 'completion': 'The coordination between FAA and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, as well as FAAâ€™s relationship with other regulatory agencies such as the FCC and its ability to address complex challenges.'}

{"prompt": "What is the role of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)?", "completion": "The NTIA is a federal agency that represents federal agency spectrum concerns to the FCC."}
{"prompt": "How does the FAA interact with other regulatory agencies like the FCC?", "completion": "The FAA maintains a relationship with other regulatory agencies such as the FCC to address complex challenges from wireless technologies."}
{"prompt": "What challenges does the FAA face with the proliferation of wireless technologies?", "completion": "The FAA faces challenges brought by the rapidly evolving technical landscape in which aviation must operate due to the proliferation of wireless technologies."}
{"prompt": "Who is Bart Elias?", "completion": "Bart Elias is a Specialist in Aviation Policy."}
{"prompt": "What document discusses aviation concerns regarding the rollout of 5G?", "completion": "The document titled 'Aviation Concerns Regarding the Rollout of 5G Wireless Telecommunications Networks' discusses these concerns."}
