{"instruction": "Why is IPAWS important for public safety?", "context": "IPAWS allows authorized federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local alerting authorities to send Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) to mobile devices and Emergency Alert System (EAS) alerts to media platforms such as radios and televisions. These alerts provide critical, lifesaving information during emergencies like wildfires and floods.", "response": "IPAWS is important for public safety because it enables authorities to deliver lifesaving information quickly and effectively during emergencies, helping protect lives and property."}
{"instruction": "What is required for a public safety agency to access IPAWS?", "context": "A public safety agency must submit an application and receive approval from FEMA to become an IPAWS alerting authority. As of September 2019, more than 1,400 alerting authorities had access to IPAWS, up from fewer than 100 in 2013. However, there are still gaps in local authority access.", "response": "Public safety agencies must submit an application and obtain FEMA's approval to access IPAWS and send alerts."}
{"instruction": "What are some challenges faced by local authorities regarding IPAWS?", "context": "While all states have at least one alerting authority, some local and tribal authorities lack access to IPAWS. There are 430 pending IPAWS applications, some dating back to 2012. These gaps can limit the timeliness and effectiveness of emergency alerts.", "response": "Local authorities face challenges such as gaps in access to IPAWS, long application backlogs, and delays in receiving approval, which hinder their ability to send timely alerts."}
{"instruction": "What improvements have FEMA and FCC made to IPAWS?", "context": "FEMA has made system upgrades, and FCC has introduced requirements for wireless carriers to improve the geographic targeting of alerts. These improvements aim to make alerts more precise and reliable, addressing concerns that inaccurate targeting made authorities hesitant to send alerts in the past.", "response": "FEMA upgraded IPAWS, and FCC improved alert precision by requiring better geographic targeting, helping alerting authorities send accurate and reliable messages."}
{"instruction": "How has the use of IPAWS changed since its launch?", "context": "Since IPAWS launched in 2012, the number of authorized alerting authorities has grown significantly. As of September 2019, more than 1,400 authorities had access to IPAWS, compared to fewer than 100 in 2013. This increase demonstrates growing adoption of the system.", "response": "The use of IPAWS has increased dramatically, with over 1,400 alerting authorities using it by 2019, compared to fewer than 100 in 2013."}
{"instruction": "What recommendations has GAO made to improve IPAWS?", "context": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) made recommendations to address pending IPAWS applications and improve the system's effectiveness.

{"instruction": "Summarize the FCC's new rule on 9-1-1 call routing.", "context": "On January 26, 2024, the FCC adopted rules requiring wireless providers to use location-based routing for 9-1-1 calls. Historically, these calls were routed based on the location of the cell tower handling the call, which sometimes caused delays as calls had to be transferred between Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). The new rules use IP-network technology to accurately determine the caller's location, reducing response times. Wireless providers must implement these changes by November 13, 2024, for calls and by May 13, 2026, for real-time texts.", "response": "The FCC adopted rules mandating location-based routing for 9-1-1 calls to improve accuracy and reduce delays. Wireless providers must comply by November 2024 for calls and May 2026 for texts."}
{"instruction": "Why did the FCC introduce location-based routing for 9-1-1 calls?", "context": "The FCC introduced location-based routing to address issues with the traditional method of routing 9-1-1 calls based on cell tower locations. This method often led to misrouted calls, requiring transfers between PSAPs and delaying emergency response. In one case, a six-year-old boy drowned when a 9-1-1 call from Missouri was routed to Colorado. Location-based routing uses IP-network technology to send calls directly to the correct PSAP, reducing delays and saving lives.", "response": "The FCC introduced location-based routing to prevent delays caused by misrouted 9-1-1 calls, ensuring calls go directly to the correct emergency center and improving response times."}
{"instruction": "What technology will be used under the FCC’s new 9-1-1 routing rules?", "context": "The new FCC rules require wireless providers to use IP-network technology for location-based routing of 9-1-1 calls. This technology determines the caller's precise location, allowing calls to be routed directly to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) without the need for time-consuming transfers.", "response": "The FCC's new rules mandate the use of IP-network technology to enable location-based routing for 9-1-1 calls, ensuring accurate routing to the correct emergency center."}
{"instruction": "What are the deadlines for implementing the FCC’s location-based routing rules?", "context": "Under the FCC’s new rules, national wireless providers must implement location-based routing for 9-1-1 wireless calls by November 13, 2024, and for real-time texts by May 13, 2026. Non-national providers have until May 13, 2026, to implement these changes for both wireless calls and texts.", "response": "National providers must implement location-based routing by November 2024 for calls and May 2026 for texts, while non-national providers have until May 2026 for both."}
{"instruction": "How does location-based routing improve 9-1-1 call handling?", "context": "Location-based routing improves 9-1-1 call handling by using the caller’s IP-network to determine their exact location, ensuring the call is routed directly to the correct Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). This eliminates the need for transferring calls between PSAPs, saving time and resources and reducing delays in emergency responses.", "response": "Location-based routing ensures 9-1-1 calls are sent directly to the correct emergency center, reducing delays and improving response times by eliminating call transfers."}
{"instruction": "What are the cost and benefits of the FCC’s location-based routing program?", "context": "The FCC estimates the cost of implementing location-based routing for 9-1-1 calls to be up to $215 million. However, the benefits include eliminating delays caused by call transfers and reducing fatalities, with an estimated benefit of $173 billion.", "response": "The FCC estimates the program will cost $215 million but will provide $173 billion in benefits by eliminating call transfer delays and reducing fatalities."}
{"instruction": "How does the FCC's rule on 9-1-1 routing affect fire departments?", "context": "The International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) supports the FCC’s rule on location-based routing for 9-1-1 calls, stating it will enhance emergency response operations. The IAFC will monitor the implementation and work to ensure fire departments can operate more effectively and efficiently.", "response": "The FCC's rule is supported by fire departments as it improves emergency response efficiency. The IAFC will monitor the implementation to ensure effectiveness."}
{"instruction": "Provide an example of how delays in 9-1-1 call routing have caused harm.", "context": "Under the previous system, a 9-1-1 call was sometimes routed to the wrong jurisdiction due to cell tower location. In July 2022, a six-year-old boy drowned after a 9-1-1 call from Missouri was mistakenly routed to Colorado, delaying the emergency response.", "response": "A six-year-old boy drowned in 2022 after a 9-1-1 call from Missouri was misrouted to Colorado, delaying the emergency response."}
